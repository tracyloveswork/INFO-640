1,A Real Conversation with Alexa,intelligent personal assistant,https://medium.com/@leobottary/a-real-conversation-with-alexa-a244d5643f0c,"Alexa is an intelligent personal assistant developed by Amazon, made popular by the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Echo Dot devices developed by Amazon Lab126. The Alexa device is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, providing weather, traffic, and other real time information, such as news and much more. Alexa can also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation system.

In November 2014, Amazon announced Alexa alongside the Echo. Alexa was inspired by the computer voice and conversational system on board the Starship Enterprise in science fiction TV series and movies. The name Alexa was selected because it has a hard consonant with the X making it recognizable with higher precision.
Several of our guests on the Year of the Peer podcast have talked about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and what it will mean for humans in this fast changing world. Many of us already engage the likes of Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana to answer questions and help us perform a wide range of tasks. So we thought, if who you surround yourself with really matters, then it’s not that far fetched to include AI devices in the mix and explore what they can really teach us — not only about how to properly engage them, but also about how we as humans can interact with one another more effectively. For these insights, we invited Alexa to join us as our special guest!
Enjoy what is largely a tongue-in-cheek podcast where, with the help of Alexa and my producer Randy Cantrell, we learn more about WHO she is and deliver some simple and important reminders. Alexa, welcome to the show!"

4,Examples of Intelligent Personal Assistant Built on Top of Cirkus,intelligent personal assistant,https://medium.com/@vlad.k/single-user-interface-in-examples-df1791488e9d,"In this article I will identify some real examples of intelligent personal assistant built on top of Cirkus when used for dealing with any particular user’s situations. The screens shown below are not complete nor perfect; however, the main point is to illuminate core principles of a personal assistant. Cirkus is an open environment, thus everybody is capable to build a perfect assistant in the future.
The main purpose of a personal assistant is to enable a real person (user) to be in permanent contact with his online identity, representing his online presence. Everyone’s and everything’s activities are fragmented into very detailed situations in Cirkus environment. Therefore, the main thing which is always shown in a personal assistant is a user’s current situation and its related service. Current user’s situation can be recognized or established by various ways. For example, the user can state or say his current need (or there can be used a mind reading approach in the future also). Another option is automatic detection of a user’s situation depending on his current circumstances. Also, the user’s situation changes as he performs actions offered by services.
Let’s have a look now at how a personal assistant can be used, for example, to order a taxi. We let a user write his requirement for a taxi simply into the text input here.

Personal assistant passes this query on the server where data of user’s online identity is stored. Next, it finds out from the knowledge, that in case of a “need a taxi” query, the user is probably in a “taxi customer” role and in a situation, when he wants to order a taxi. Additional information that we get from the knowledge is when situations of others match to a user’s current situation. In the case of a taxi ordering, matching situations are those representing available taxi drivers. Another piece of information obtainable from the knowledge is that we can order a taxi ride if we have a taxi driver. All of this information we got from the knowledge is then mashed-up together with users’ data and returned back to a personal assistant in the form of a situational service.

All the situations appear in personal assistant in its textual form. Possible actions appear in the form of controls like buttons or menu items. Actions, when performed, change current user’s situation and possibly the situation of other users. The knowledge configures what types of different situations should be simultaneously created for different roles. Thus, when the user press the “Order” button from our example, he reaches a new situation: “I ordered new taxi ride”.

Simultaneously, the taxi driver gets into the new “I got new taxi ride” situation.

Similar to the previous example, if I want to write a blog post I could just send a query “write a blog post”.

Given by the knowledge, it means I’m in the “blogger” role and the situation when I want to write a blog post. Among the other information, there is a blog post entity with its properties configured in the knowledge for this type of situation. Thus, personal assistant shows input form to fill in all the necessary blog post content.

In a “I have a blog” situation, the user can see his blog posts and a button which leads to the creation of new blog post. More precisely, it leads to the same situation (“I want to write a blog post”) which we got into with the previous “write a blog post” textual input.

Personal assistant can also suggest future situations and actions automatically dependent on the current user’s state, his current role and situation, location, time, etc.

Personal assistant also enables us to see other online identities and it’s relations in the same way as we browse common websites. For example, there is a configured a Cirkus Environment Reader role in the knowledge and its possible situations and actions towards Cirkus Environment and related online identities. Textual information represent properties of these identities, while navigation items represent possible Cirkus Environment Reader’s actions.

Application of the knowledge to our data and its interpretation in a personal assistant brings us plenty of new possibilities in terms of seamless interactions amongst users. We will cover another interesting examples in detail in some of next articles."
5,Contribution of an intelligent personal assistant in Our Daily Life,intelligent personal assistant,https://medium.com/@namejacob16/contribution-of-an-intelligent-personal-assistant-in-our-daily-life-4b45b36836e0,"An intelligent personal assistant is also known as Automated Personal Assistance. It is a program that can perform tasks as though it were a human. The task to which IPA will respond is based on an input and location recognition. IPA is also capable of fetching the information from a variety of online sources like weather updates, stock prices, latest news etc. AI Personal Assistant technology is accredited by the concoction of API, Smart Phones and the escalation of mobile apps. However, it designed in such a way that it can perform any task given by an individual but the limitation of this system is that it can perform one task at a time by hearing the voice instructions of the user. One of the key features of an AI Personal Assistant is that it organizes information according to an individual’s needs, including the management of calendar events, emails, to-do-list, files, music etc.
Most people are unaware that they are using an intelligent personal assistant in their everyday life in the form of applications like LG G3’s Voice Mate, Samsung’s S Voice, Google’s Google Home, Amazon Alexa and many others. These software solutions are the best example of IPA and help us to manage a proper schedule of tasks in our busy life. We all are aware of Apple’s Siri, which is also an AI Personal Assistant that helps us in doing things like sending text messages, checking the weather, and reminders setting, playing music list as well as it also answer the question about geographical locations through GPS system. For this, you have to only ask Siri for the things you want to do and rest she we will arrange things according to your comfort and need.
AI Personal Assistant not only reminds you of what to do at a certain time but it will also remind you what to do at certain place.. And when you want to send text messages, you don’t need to lay your fingers on the Smartphone, you only need to tell the message and sender name, and then automatically AI Personal Assistant sent it to your recipient. All these small-small things that we use in our daily life in our mobile phones become hi-tech and helps us to save our time in many other ways. With the help of the evolution of IPA, now there is no need to hire a personal assistant for maintaining and scheduling personal and professional activities because it can do anything that one personal assistance can do for you, even it is smarter, faster and secure than human being and resolve any problems within a seconds.
In India, there are many software companies thatare working on AI Personal Assistant designing and provide Free CRM Software that helps in engulfing broad set of applications to manage the data of customer for business purpose. It also very helpful in maintaining the proper interaction between company and customer, access business information, marketing, automate sales, marketing and customer support."

7,The intelligent Personal Assistant,intelligent personal assistant,https://medium.com/@mrtomconnelly/in-1997-my-father-purchased-some-voice-recognition-software-called-naturallyspeaking-by-dragon-5f454a3b380e,"In 1997 my father purchased some voice recognition software called NaturallySpeaking by Dragon Systems. It was my first introduction to voice recognition technology and although it wasn’t 100% accurate (it really was quite useless), I was amazed that it was possible.
These days all you have to do is say “OK Google” or “Hey Siri” and your phone is ready to take your command. Setting reminders, sending text messages, and making calls is only a taste of what can be actioned via voice commands.
Voice recognition technology has come a long way.
I’m an avid user of Google’s intelligent personal assistant (IPA) service Google Now aka “OK Google”. The thing is, I don’t like using it in public. When I do, I try to keep it discreet until I give up and switch back to the ol’ fingers and thumbs. Friends and family I’ve spoken to say they feel the same way.
I feel like this technology is going through its teething stage where we’re not sure if it’s cool yet. This is such a great tool but it must be embraced in order for it to improve and be used more across more applications. What can be done to help this technology be adopted by the mainstream and socially accepted?
Allow custom wake up commands
I don’t want to walk down the street saying “Ok Google”. Why can’t I create my own activation phrase? I’d be much more comfortable using my IPA in public if I was able to say something like “Are you ready?”. As far as I’m aware, S Voice for Samsung is the only IPA that allows custom wake up commands.
Make it so I can “call” my intelligent personal assistant
I want push a button, put my phone to my ear and hear a voice say “How can I help?”. Imagine it, you could be rushing to work talking to your IPA on the phone, sending texts, writing emails, learning your agenda for the day and more. Voice recognition works best when your mouth is directly next to the receiver anyway. Why not hold it to your head like you’re on a call?
Flip it on its head – Dictaphone style
I often turn my phone upside down and speak into it like a dictaphone. This allows me speak directly into the receiver and glance down to my screen for more information. The problem is my phone doesn’t automatically invert the screen when the phone is the wrong way around. This idea impacts the phone’s operating system and the possibly the phones design rather than functionality of the IPA software.
“Is there anything else I can help you with today?”
When I make a voice command and it’s answered, the IPA should continually ask me “Can I help you with anything else?”. This would eliminates the need to repeat the voice recognition command and facilitate multiple commands.
This powerful technology won’t be applied to more apps and tools until it becomes adopted by the mainstream. For this to happen, I believe the way users engage with IPA software must be matched with existing technologies that they are familiar with and feel comfortable using."
8,Apple Inc. To Replace Intelligent Personal Assistant Siri With Viv,intelligent personal assistant,https://medium.com/@praneethrover/apple-inc-to-replace-intelligent-personal-assistant-siri-with-viv-6ee3772b3149,"Apple Siri is gonna expire soon. Dag Kittlaus and Adam Cheyer, Inventors of Siri, have invented a new Artificial Intelligence Technology called ‘Viv‘. It is a powerful AI invented by Siri’s creators from APPLE which can be able to learn from the world to improve upon its capabilities.
Apple is the world’s largest IT company by revenue and 2nd largest mobile manufacturing company. This AI bot is more advanced than Siri and is super smart than any human being or any virtual assistant which can be able to carry out any complex tasks by mimicking the knowledge data-base of a human assistant.
Actually, “Viv” was named after the Latin root meaning of ‘Life’. It is more advanced than Siri, Google, Cortana or Alexa. According to the inventors the Viv is supposed to be more flexible in its own way and providing the need or feel of a human."
9,BMW Introduces Intelligent Personal Assistant for its Cars,intelligent personal assistant,https://medium.com/@techstoryin/bmw-introduces-intelligent-personal-assistant-for-its-cars-9e0320af4add,"Gone are the days when cars were only used to go from one place to other. Today, they are a mark of luxury, comfort, and convenience. And the manufacturers are also not keeping it loose in providing the best and effortless experience for their customers. Taking a step further in this direction, BMW has introduced an Intelligent Personal assistant (IPA) for its cars to keep the driver free from doing anything.
The IPA will hear you when you say, “Hey BMW,” and the name can be changed to anything you want it to be called. Once it hears you, you can ask it to manage or change any functions of the car including the navigation, climate control lighting, infotainment system, headlight settings, and almost every other thing that is electrically controlled.

The IPA will join the driver as a stranger with basic settings at first, then it will keep learning about the driver’s preferences and routines. “BMW’s Personal Assistant gets to know you over time with each of your voice commands and by using your car,” BMW’s senior vice president Digital Products and Services, Dieter May, said. “It gets better and better every single day.”

The Personal assistance will also be able to react to natural human commands, so you could say, “Hey BMW, I’m cold,” and it will adjust the climate control accordingly. BMW says the IPA is the ideal co-driver, as you could ask it to search for nearby gas stations, restaurants, available parking spots, etc.

BMW has recently partnered with Amazon for the voice assistance technology. While the IPA will make your driving experience better, Alexa will look after your shopping, your smart devices at home and office, and all other tasks. By integrating these two, you can have a seamless movement during your day without having to carry or remember any information.
BMW has had a long partnership with Microsoft with its cloud platform Azure. The latest BMW Intelligent Assistance is also built on top of Azure and conversational technologies. BMW has also integrated office 365 and Skype with its IPA, so, the driver can manage the work and attend skype conferences along the way. It is expected that Microsoft’s voice assistant Cortana will also be joining the BMW cars soon.
The BMW Intelligent Personal assistance will be rolled out from March 2019 as standard in the new X5, Z4, and the 8-Series models, an over-the-air software upgrade. The IPA will also be available in the 3-series but as an option and the service will be offered for three years only."
10,Intelligent Personal Assistant Recommendation for College Students,intelligent personal assistant,https://medium.com/@luhan_91776/to-be-continue-5863317aaf1c,"Introduction:
This recommendation report will evaluate and compare the most popular three intelligent personal assistants Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, from the technology aspect and application aspect, regarding their speech recognition system and users’ experience. The report will use different research methods for two aspects. The technology aspect will focus on the speech recognition system while the application aspect evaluates Intelligent personal assistants’ performance to implement the popular and useful functions that customers value the most.
Background:
With the development of AI technology, one of its applications, intelligent personal assistant, has become more and more popular. Installed on laptops, smartphones or other electronic devices, the intelligent personal assistants take over tedious things that people used to manage on their own and help. More and more college students start to use intelligent personal assistants as well for study or entertainment. Intelligent personal assistants integrate data from apps to make information easier to process. Useful functions are taking voice notes, finding study guides and materials, playing music, checking emails, notifying essential events, making schedules, etc.
The evaluation will be among Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana. Siri is the Intelligent personal assistant launched by Apple, it is released as part of the integrated system of IOS and thus could be only used in Apple products. Google Assistant, firstly launched and installed on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phone, is also compatible with android, Snoy and IOS systems additional to Google devices. The Microsoft Cortana is available on Windows 10 desktops and mobile devices as well as other systems like android and IOS. Amazon Alexa is not in comparison as the selected Intelligent personal assistant all have mobile used.
While customers sometimes complain that intelligent assistants are ‘not human enough’ due to the limitations of AI technologies, others think that designed functions are cool but not useful. I would conduct comparisons based on the technology and application aspects between these three products. The report will use different research methods for two aspects. The technology aspect will mainly analyze graphs or statistics from companies who own the products and research papers from third-party experts, while the application aspect used the stats from the online survey to find out the popular functions users do with their Intelligent personal assistants. Then I would use a personal test to determine how each Intelligent personal assistant perform under different scenarios.
Technology aspect (Speech Recognition System):
Speech recognition is a type of algorithm that enables the program to identify human words and convert them into information that is readable by machines. It’s an essential feature for Intelligent personal assistants to record and analyze users’ verbal commands and implement further instructions. On the other hand, the misunderstanding of commands and wrong-capturing of words would increase inconvenience for Intelligent personal assistants’ users.
Speech recognition works in the usage of algorithms via acoustic and language modeling. Acoustic modeling shows the connection between linguistic devices of speech and audio indicators while language modeling fits sounds with phrase sequences to assist distinguish between phrases that sound comparable. The performance of speech recognition is evaluated by accuracy and speed. Word Error Rate(WER) could show the accuracy of how the word is identified in transcription but cannot analyze the error that occurred.
In August 2017, researchers of Microsoft Artificial Intelligence & Research group announced their latest result that the speech cognition technology has achieved 5.1 percent of word error rate on the 2000 Switchboard evaluation set (W. Xiong) due to ‘a series of improvements to the neural net-based acoustic and language models’ said Microsoft technical fellow Xuedong Huang. With the same speech cognition ability as a human professional transcriber (daily mail), Cortana is placed in the line with professions with the aid of the latest speech cognition technology.
Two types of Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN) are used in the system to increase the accuracy to perceive the words. CNN is a class of deep artificial neural networks, a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks that could learn how to complete tasks by considering examples and analyzing visual imagery. (W. Xiong)
ResNet CNN uses the powerful highway connections to linearly transform inputs to output while the LACE model extracts simple local patterns and complex patterns at the same time to enable the process of a large amount of vocabulary running through the system. And last but not least, the new additional CNN-BLSTM model greatly improves accuracy by separating the words into pieces based on the time difference and cutting the same command into more pieces and examine each section more detailed. As a result of the improvements in acoustic models, Cortana reaches the low word error 5.1 %.(W. Xiong)
Another group of researchers from Montana State University experiment on the performance of the speech recognition system of Apple Siri and Google Speech Recognition (GSR) under different network conditions. While enhancing different applications in real-life scenarios, the speech recognition system would have message delays caused by packet loss and jitter, which led to low accuracy and speed for the information transmitted. (Mehdi).
In the experiment, the researchers set up two models to evaluate the message delay of Apple Sir and GSR under different packet loss and jitter respectively.

In the experiment, the same 26.4-second client’s voice package was transmitted through the netem box (traffic shaper in the graph) to vary the network conditions and imitate the packet loss and jitter. After GSR and Siri receive and translate the voice data, the results are sent back to the clients. The roundtrip time (the time after GSR and Siri receive the text) shows message delay and the accuracy, measured by comparing the match percentage of the original string in the voice package with the final context from the speech recognizer. (Mehdi).
The results showed that both packet loss and jitter impact the performance of speech recognizer., but Siri had much more delay than GSR. The following graphs demonstrate the impact of packet loss and jitter on the delay of GSR and Siri. Siri caused delay by 3.5 to 5.0 second when packet loss is 1% to 5% while GSR had less than 3.0-second delay even under the highest value of packet loss. Regarding the impact of jitter from 20ms to 180ms, GSR also has a lower average delay than Siri. (Mehdi).


After comparing the obtained results with the Walch t-test, the result found out the mean difference between the two speech recognizer systems is 1.666s (p-value < 2.2e-16), which indicates a significant difference. The majority of the delay of Siri was caused by the algorithm that allows Siri to start to recognize voice only after receiving the entire string. On the other hand, GSR processed the information after receiving the first voice package. It adjusted transport and application layers to keep the result accurate under huge interference with high values of jitter and packet loss. Combining results of the experiment with the standardized industrial tests, the researcher found out that the word error rate for Siri is 5.0% (L) while GSR has a lower word error rate of 4.9% (E).

Graph 1: Comparison of Voice Recognition Systems among the three Intelligent personal assistants
Conclusion for technology aspect:
Siri, Google Assistant, and Cortana all have a powerful speech recognition system with a comparatively low word error rate (< 10%). To sum up, the speech recognition error rate of Siri is 5.0 %(L), with the lowest error rate of Google Assistant as 4.9%(E) and the highest error rate of Cortana 5.1%. So, if looking solely at word error rate in the speech recognition system. Goggle Assistant is the winner.
Yet, the Intelligent personal assistants with extraordinary speech cognition system still have limitations, as the researchers of Cortana said, the ultimate goal of speech cognition system is not only to accurately capture the words but also to understand the content. But anyway, the former is the foundation that prepares Intelligent personal assistants to be more intelligent and Google assistants with GSR win this competition of word rate error.
Application Aspect (User experience):
The second aspect evaluates the ability of Siri, Cortana and Google Assistant to implement useful functions regarding user experiences. Whether Intelligent personal assistants are useful depending on their performance to implement the popular functions that customers value the most. I would carry on a personal test to three products to determine how each Intelligent personal assistant performed on the popular situations that people would use Intelligent personal assistants.
The statistics represented the results of an online survey conducted from 1040 respondents in the United States in April 2017 and showed that people may use their Intelligent personal assistants mostly in the following situations. For college students especially, the stats (HigherVisibility) also found that they prefer functions like manage alarms, play music, check weather reports and loop up news headlines, highly matched the stats in Graph 2.

Graph 2: Situations where people would use virtual assistants(Statista)
Based on the rank of 6 popular tasks, I would test the three Intelligent personal assistants under specific scenarios and evaluate their performances respectively. I used iPhone 6s for Apple Siri. For Google’s Assistant, I used Google Pixel XL. I used ThinkPad X200 to test Cortana on Windows.
The following are the performances of the three Intelligent personal assistants in six situations.
Music
Scenarios: I asked each assistant to play 10 songs from different ages. Some are not popular and in foreign languages. Google Assistant got 9 out of 10, Siri and Cortana got 7 out of 10.
Siri works with Apple Music mostly while Cortana is with Groove Music developed by Microsoft but is little-known. The supported media with Google Assistant is more diverse from Spotify, Google Play Music to YouTube increases the possibility to find the specific songs wanted by users. Google Assistant scores 2 and Siri, Cortana 1.
2. Weather
Scenarios: I asked ‘what’s the weather like tomorrow?’ followed up by ‘what about Goleta?’ and ‘Should I bring an umbrella?’
All three assistants could answer the first question but for the second question, Google Assistant correctly interpret the second question and pulled out similar information while both Cortana and Siri didn’t understand the questions and had to ask direct questions about the weather at Goleta. When I asked ‘should I bring an umbrella?’ Cortana directly responded ‘That’s probably not necessary.’ then told me the temperature and the weather like today with detailed information. Siri did the same. Google Assistant score 3, Cortana scores 2 and Siri scores 2.

Cortona (left), Siri (right)
3. Calendar/Schedule
Scenarios: I asked, ‘What’s my schedule tomorrow?’, ‘set a schedule for essay tomorrow at 4PM’, ‘Change the time of product recommendation appointment tomorrow.’
All three assistants could pull out the information about my schedule tomorrow and easily create an appointment, but Siri who can directly interface with the phone’s calendar makes it easier to modify the events’ time or delete events. Cortana asked me to specify the reference to the meeting while modifying it and couldn’t create or modify the appointments through voice alone. For Google Assistant, it’s smooth at set up events but cannot modify afterward.
Siri scores 3, Cortana scores 2 and Google Assistants scores 1.
4. Email
Scenarios: I asked ‘Send an email to Lu Han’, ‘Do I have new email?’ and ‘Read my recent emails’.
Siri prefers to work with Apple Mail while Google Assistant prefers Gmail. But both could recognize the name, write the message through users’ voice and send the email. In contrast, although Cortana can achieve deep voice interaction like Siri and Google Assistant, its recognition of voice names is poor and the error rate is high. Siri did the best job at the check and read new emails. At the scenario interaction level, Siri understands the semantics and correctly calls recently unread mails; on the functional level, Siri can also fine-tune recently unread mails in chronological order/sort order to display or read. Google Assistant displayed a random email from months ago and didn’t link to the Gmail app. Cortana brought up a browse page and opened Bing search for the question. Siri scores 3, Google Assistant 2 and Cortana 1.
5. News
Scenarios: I asked, ‘What’s the news today?’ ‘Tech News?’
Google Assistant could identify the users’ requests and return the correct query results. For the third-party integration, Google News assistant supports the most extensive search from BBC, VOA, Fox News to Bloomberg. Siri also understood my request for today’s news and collected news from NYTimes to VOA. Cortana pulled up top stories for today and read the first headings for me, integrated news mostly from Fox News (nearly all the top news is Fox News). Both Cortana and Goggle Assistant could pull up the latest Tech News Compared with other intelligent virtual assistants, Google Assistant has integrated a large number of third-party news media as news sources in news topics and greatly enhanced the user experience. Google Assistant scores 3, Cortana scores 2 and Siri scores 2.
6. Calling Uber
Scenarios: I asked, ‘Call me an Uber.’
Siri can interact with the user in destination confirmation, model selection, and vehicle booking and help users to achieve path planning and riding cost estimation through the integrated map function. Because Google Assistant and Cortana does not integrate third-party taxi applications, it can’t interact in this area and couldn’t identify this semantic recognition. Siri scores 2. Google Assistant and Cortana scores 1.
Data Processing:
After collecting all the scores, I made a decision matrix to describe the multi-criteria decision analysis problem and evaluate the strength and the weakness of the Intelligent personal assistants based on the criteria in Graph 2. The first column of the table is the functions with the ranking of popularity. The scores (1 to 3) are given for each Intelligent personal assistant to show their performance in particular functions. The score would be the same depends on how Intelligent personal assistants performed. The final evaluation considered both the share of respondents (refer to graph 2) and Intelligent personal assistants’ performances. The former would be the weight of the latter and the Intelligent personal assistant performed well in the popular functions would have the highest score.

Table1: Comparison of Intelligent personal assistants using decision matrix
Conclusion for application aspect:
From the evaluation, Google Assistant scores the highest with Apple Siri behind. Microsoft Cortana scores the lowest.
In the test scenarios that have been implemented and integrated with other Google applications like YouTube and Gmail, Google Assistant performed extremely well. It also showed the semantic understanding stronger than other virtual assistants, in the scenarios of asking the weather, sending voice email and selecting the news. However, Google Assistant still has problems in the integration of phone-based applications like Calendar. But with its advanced technology to implement great semantic understanding in users’ requests, Google Assistant keeps being the most promising Intelligent personal assistant with high developmental potential.
Apple Siri did a good job to integrate phone modules and third-party applications. With the advantages of phone manufacturers, it performed well in setting and adjusting the schedule, writing voice email and calling Uber, the functions that relate basic phone functions and system feature. Although its in-depth semantic understanding of individual scenes is slightly weaker than that of Google Assistant, Apple Siri performed better functional modules after understanding the scenarios than other intelligent virtual assistants due to its integration of third-party applications.
Compared to the other two intelligent virtual assistants, Cortana is slightly inferior. Its incomplete establishment of an intelligent knowledge base led to the semantic misunderstanding of user’s requests and can only call Bing search processing. Its ability to integrate third-party applications is weaker than the other two Intelligent personal assistants. Cortana still has a long way to go, regarding the establishment of the semantic knowledge base, as well as the building of functions, the integration of third-party applications and so on.
