1,Understanding the long-term use of smart speaker assistants,smart speaker,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3264901,"Over the past two years the Ubicomp vision of ambient voice assistants, in the form of smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home, has been integrated into tens of millions of homes. However, the use of these systems over time in the home has not been studied in depth. We set out to understand exactly what users are doing with these devices over time through analyzing voice history logs of 65,499 interactions with existing Google Home devices from 88 diverse homes over an average of 110 days. We found that specific types of commands were made more often at particular times of day and that commands in some domains increased in length over time as participants tried out new ways to interact with their devices, yet exploration of new topics was low. Four distinct user groups also emerged based on using the device more or less during the day vs. in the evening or using particular categories. We conclude by comparing smart speaker use to a similar study of smartphone use and offer implications for the design of new smart speaker assistants and skills, highlighting specific areas where both manufacturers and skill providers can focus in this domain."
2,Google Home: smart speaker as environmental control unit,smart speaker,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17483107.2017.1369589,"Environmental Control Units (ECU) are devices or a system that allows a person to control appliances in their home or work environment. Such system can be utilized by clients with physical and/or functional disability to enhance their ability to control their environment, to promote independence and improve their quality of life. Over the last several years, there have been an emergence of several inexpensive, commercially-available, voice activated smart speakers into the market such as Google Home and Amazon Echo. These smart speakers are equipped with far field microphone that supports voice recognition, and allows for complete hand-free operation for various purposes, including for playing music, for information retrieval, and most importantly, for environmental control. Clients with disability could utilize these features to turn the unit into a simple ECU that is completely voice activated and wirelessly connected to appliances. Smart speakers, with their ease of setup, low cost and versatility, may be a more affordable and accessible alternative to the traditional ECU.

Implications for Rehabilitation
Environmental Control Units (ECU) enable independence for physically and functionally disabled clients, and reduce burden and frequency of demands on carers.

Traditional ECU can be costly and may require clients to learn specialized skills to use.

Smart speakers have the potential to be used as a new-age ECU by overcoming these barriers, and can be used by a wider range of clients."
3,Investigating the usability and user experiences of voice user interface: a case of Google home smart speaker,smart speaker,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3236130,"Recently, commercial Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) have been introduced to the market (e.g. Amazon Echo and Google Home). Although they have drawn much attention from users, little is known about their usability, user experiences, and usefulness. In this study, we conducted a web-based survey to investigate usability, user experiences, and usefulness of the Google Home smart speaker. A total of 114 users, who are active in a social-media based interest group, participated in the study. The findings show that the Google Home is usable and user-friendly for users, and shows the potential for international users. Based on the users' feedback, we identified the challenges encountered by the participants. The findings from this study can be insightful for researchers and developers to take into account for future research in VUI."
4,Home-based exercise system for patients using IoT enabled smart speaker,smart speaker,https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.pratt.edu/abstract/document/8210826/,"Physical therapy has a lot of importance for the well being and a better quality of living for an elderly patient. One integral constituent of any patient regime is the home-based exercise that a patient works on in a much comfortable environment. Although the benefits are well known, there is a big lag between the exercises prescribed by the therapists and the ones actually done by the patient. There is no cost effective and non-complex methods available to quantify the exercises performed by the patient. In this paper, a study was performed to check the validity and efficiency of a system consisting of a Smart IoT enabled speaker, which contains an orchestrator. Which is speech learning unit, an exercise database at the edge, and connected to the cloud, where the generated reports are stored and transferred for further analysis, if required. We report the efficiency of the system compared to the ratings of a physical therapist, a standard currently being used."
5,A hardware framework for smart speaker control of home audio network,smart speaker,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5681134/,"Multi-channel speaker systems are typically driven by central power amplifiers. This approach has limitations when faced with the increasing number of channels in existing systems. In this paper, more distributed approach to multi-channel systems is proposed where a USB cable is used as an interface to a living room PC to connect to the proposed main controller. The main controller connects all speaker channels serially via a network cable through subcontrollers that are distributed across the rooms. The network cable interface between the sub-controllers and the main controller uses a custom-made transmission protocol. This protocol allows the main controller to provide multiple CD quality audio sources to different locations in a house. Furthermore we demonstrate a bidirectional communication capability to allow seamless personalized listening at all locations in the home with the proposed protocol between the main controller and the sub-controllers."

STARHome, a fully functional smart home prototype. We
make use of speech and speaker recognition technologies to
provide three voice services, namely, voice command for
controlling home appliances, voice biometric for entrancedoor access control, and service customization (speaker-loaded
command control). Voice applications for STARHome have
been designed to deal with short utterances and low SNR.

7,"A 4Ω 2.65 W class-D audio amplifier with embedded DC-DC boost converter, current sensing ADC and DSP for adaptive speaker protection",smart speaker,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6644326/,In this paper a class-D smart speaker driver is presented that can deliver 2.65 W at 1% THD into a 4Ω load. Maximal output power is maintained at low battery voltage by supplying the class-D amplifier from a DC-DC boost converter. Speaker damage is avoided by a speaker protection algorithm that runs on an embedded DSP. The protection algorithm estimates the membrane excursion and voice coil temperature using a speaker model that tracks the speaker impedance which is determined by measuring the speaker current with less than 2% relative error. A sample & hold technique is presented that rejects the load current ripple by sampling at the moments where the instantaneous load current equals the average current. At full output power the combined efficiency of the class-D amplifier and DC-DC boost converter is higher than 80%. The complete system is implemented on a single chip that measures 6.6 mm 2 and is fabricated in a 0.14 μm CMOS technology with a 5 V gate-oxide option.
8,Measuring user satisfaction on smart speaker intelligent assistants using intent sensitive query embeddings,smart speaker,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3271802,"Intelligent assistants are increasingly being used on smart speaker devices, such as Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple Homepod, and Harmon Kardon Invoke with Cortana. Typically, user satisfaction measurement relies on user interaction signals, such as clicks and scroll movements, in order to determine if a user was satisfied. However, these signals do not exist for smart speakers, which creates a challenge for user satisfaction evaluation on these devices. In this paper, we propose a new signal, user intent, as a means to measure user satisfaction. We propose to use this signal to model user satisfaction in two ways: 1) by developing intent sensitive word embeddings and then using sequences of these intent sensitive query representations to measure user satisfaction; 2) by representing a user's interactions with a smart speaker as a sequence of user intents and thus using this sequence to identify user satisfaction. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed user satisfaction models based on the intent-sensitive query representations have statistically significant improvements over several baselines in terms of common classification evaluation metrics. In particular, our proposed task satisfaction prediction model based on intent-sensitive word embeddings has a 11.81% improvement over a generative model baseline and 6.63% improvement over a user satisfaction prediction model based on Skip-gram word embeddings in terms of the F1 metric. Our findings have implications for the evaluation of Intelligent Assistant systems."
9,Smart room: Participant and speaker localization and identification,smart speaker,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1415605/,"Our long-term objective is to create smart room technologies that are aware of the users presence and their behavior and can become an active, but not an intrusive, part of the interaction. In this work, we present a multimodal approach for estimating and tracking the location and identity of the participants including the active speaker. Our smart room design contains three user-monitoring systems: four CCD cameras, an omnidirectional camera and a 16 channel microphone array. The various sensory modalities are processed both individually and jointly and it is shown that the multimodal approach results in significantly improved performance in spatial localization, identification and speech activity detection of the participants."
10,Impact of domain and user's learning phase on task and session identification in smart speaker intelligent assistants,smart speaker,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3271803,"Task and session identification is a key element of system evaluation and user behavior modeling in Intelligent Assistant (IA) systems. However, identifying task and sessions for IAs is challenging due to the multi-task nature of IAs and the differences in the ways they are used on different platforms, such as smart-phones, cars, and smart speakers. Furthermore, usage behavior may differ among users depending on their expertise with the system and the tasks they are interested in performing. In this study, we investigate how to identify tasks and sessions in IAs given these differences. To do this, we analyze data based on the interaction logs of two IAs integrated with smart-speakers. We fit Gaussian Mixture Models to estimate task and session boundaries and show how a model with 3 components models user interactivity time better than a model with 2 components. We then show how session boundaries differ for users depending on whether they are in a learning-phase or not. Finally, we study how user inter-activity times differs depending on the task that the user is trying to perform. Our findings show that there is no single task or session boundary that can be used for IA evaluation. Instead, these boundaries are influenced by the experience of the user and the task they are trying to perform. Our findings have implications for the study and evaluation of Intelligent Agent Systems."
