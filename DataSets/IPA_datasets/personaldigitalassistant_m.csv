1,Utah Fishing Alexa Skill Helps Find Hot Fishing Spots,personal digital assistant,https://medium.com/@utahgov/utah-fishing-alexa-skill-helps-find-hot-fishing-spots-e03263a727da,"Nothing beats good advice when you’re looking for a great day of fishing. Now Utahns can simply ask a personal digital assistant for some of the best advice from state’s best experts. The Division of Wildlife Resources announced the launch of the Utah Fishing skill for the Amazon Echo. The Alexa skill gives full fishing reports for fishing spots across the state of Utah.
“It’s incredibly fun to play with,” said David Fletcher, Utah Chief Technology Officer. “But then it becomes clear that it is a great tool to learn about some of Utah’s best fishing holes.”
Utah Fishing will help anglers find the best fishing spots across the state. The Alexa skill tells fisherman the status at the Utah fishing spots, the conditions, bait that has been working, and what species are biting. The reports are updated regularly by local experts who have the best information.
“If you’ve ever had a friend that kept you up-to- date on fishing hotspots, that’s what it’s like,” said Mike Fowlks, Division of Wildlife Resources’ interim director. “Except you have all the expertise of the DWR.”
To use the skill for Alexa users simply:
— Tell Alexa to enable Utah Fishing
— Ask, “Alexa, open Utah Fishing.”
— Then say, “Alexa, what’s the fishing report for Strawberry Reservoir?”
Or any of the 148 fishing spots cataloged in the Alexa skill.

3,iPhone X is clearly a little ghost of the Palm Pre,personal digital assistant,https://medium.com/@knatham/iphone-x-is-clearly-a-little-ghost-of-the-palm-pre-ea55a2988db4,"The mobile revolution started in many ways by the Palm Pilot way back in 1997. The Palm Pilot is a Personal Digital Assistant that created a new market segment for hand held devices. Apple entered the hand held devices space many years later but is still seen as the inventor of mobile technologies like touch screens. Many Apple fans seem to miss the basic fact that touchscreens existed a long time ago, and Palm was a pioneer in this space. Palm’s smartphones had touchscreens a long time before the first iPhone was introduced in 2007. And Palm’s Pre smartphone that was introduced in 2009 had another revolutionary user interface — the deck of cards activity design interface for switching between apps using simple gestures. When the 3rd generation iPhone was launched, Apple cautiously used a version of the cards interface by displaying just the application icons instead of the shrunk version of the application snapshot. Apple also used the center button interface to invoke its version of cards. But the iPhone X has clearly infringed on Palm’s patented cards activity design. With the removal of the center button, Apple has used the same gestures to invoke the cards interface. This is the exact mechanism that was once made popular by the Palm Pre.
2018 could very well be the year where the smartphone community finally acknowledges Palm’s creativity in this space. I say this because Qualcomm, which now owns some of Palm’s patents on the deck of cards, has filed a patent infringement case on Apple. In November 2017, Qualcomm filed a case with the district court for the Southern District of California, asserting that Apple infringed on 5 of its patents — 4 out of which were purchased from Palm. Regardless of the outcome of the case, as Palm’s ex-employee and long term fan, I’m happy that Palm’s patents have passed the test of time and hopefully it will finally get recognition for its inventions."
4,It Is All About the Timing! The Revival of Failed Concepts…,personal digital assistant,https://medium.com/venturesight/it-is-all-about-the-timing-the-revival-of-failed-concepts-5a8f60f8f440,"It is starting to feel like we are seeing it over and over again. The Personal Digital Assistant, or more commonly known as PDA(even with cellular functionality), came out years before an iPhone. While many Japanese automobile manufacturers produced electric vehicles before Tesla came into play. Timing these days seem to be even more crucial in a rapidly changing environment, hitting the market little too early could spell disaster or hitting the market too late could mean you’re the laggard business in the market.

Although a number of other factors did play a part in the success or failure of these innovations, the timing did play a large part and it can be possible to foresee it. So what does timing mean? What it really means is, are the important success factors for your new business opportunity in place and ready for it.
For example, is your market already signaling adoption of your offering? are regulatory institutions prepared to address your offering?
… So what is next to for a revival?…
An interesting case is AR glasses, although one of Google’s huge flops (released 5 years ago), they had good reason to believe that this was a potential future. They did lack seeing how ugly they looked and failed to realize potential concerns that people have with privacy, among other things.
The rise of augmented reality, with growing support systems like releases of developer ARKits and technological development in laser-based displays can lead to a revival of these AR Smartglasses products.

Focals by North, seem to be making a good impression, although the price is still a deterrence with essentially expecting to pay around $600-$1000, and the technology still has some way to go to reach the same future Google had originally envisioned. Microsoft’s new release of Hololens 2, and Magic Leap are said to be working on their next model suggests there is a significant interest in this area. The ecosystem will definitely push the AR glasses forward, so this is an emerging industry to watch out for in the coming years.
What other products/services do you see today, that are actually too soon?
Are there any other revivals going to happen within the next 3 years?

5,Did Facebook just escalate the battle of digital assistants to enterprise?,personal digital assistant,https://medium.com/@vishrutshukla/did-facebook-just-escalate-the-battle-of-digital-assistants-to-enterprise-bb1dccec3eec,"Although rather nimbly, Facebook yesterday unveiled its take on a personal digital assistant for iOS and Android users. Dubbed “Facebook Here” by TechCrunch, the low-publicized “feature” lives inside Notifications area on the app. Here adopts the now fairly standard card-based UI to show information such as your friends’ birthdays, life events, upcoming sports and events, TV shows, what’s trending and geo-specific content such as nearby places, movies/theatres, local events and news etc.
With this, Facebook finally gets a level playing field to take Google’s recently announced Google Now on Tap contextual service and Microsoft’s Cortana personal assistant head-on for consumers. Consider this:
· Facebook has an extremely rich social profile of yours — which Google and Microsoft lack. It exactly knows your friends, strength of your relationship with them, your messages, activity updates, places you’ve visited, content you read and share and much more
· By mining your social graph, Facebook can surface things which interest you. On the contrary, Now and Cortana can surface in the moment factual information unless they explicitly enquire about your tastes and preferences to learn over time
· Users already spend a significant share of daily screen time on the Facebook app — especially hooked to the Notifications tab. Importantly, almost every notification row elicits a user action. Showing relevant, timely content on the same tab just feels natural!
But wait a minute… Is this “me-too” assistant the only card that Facebook has up its sleeves? Perhaps not.
Later yesterday, Facebook announced a huge win for its FB@Work enterprise collaboration and productivity offering: Royal Bank of Scotland adopted the platform for its 100k employees. Superimpose this big announcement on top of the Here “feature” launch and new possibilities start to emerge!
Can Facebook Here — in its current form — be a precursor to a “smart, fully enterprise context-aware digital personal assistant living right inside FB@Work?”
With 300 businesses already using FB@Work within 10 months of its public unveiling, Facebook appears serious in this enterprise play largely seen as an attempt to secure an alternate source of B2B revenue in addition to its ads-based monetization. Competitors Google and Microsoft both already have years to deep enterprise reach (and hence, real enterprise user and activity data) with offerings such as Google Apps for Work, Microsoft’s Yammer and SharePoint. To add to it, interactive services such as Google Now are ready to surface relevant work-related content/notifications/reminders to enterprise workers.
Here appears fit to fill this gap for Facebook. There is nothing that beats showing enterprise information workers (IWs) in-the-moment, relevant and actionable cards straight within their company’s social network. If we’re reading the signs correctly, the Here+FB@Work combo certainly doesn’t seem like a far-fetched dream. It’s almost here!"
6,Let Cortana Translate For You,personal digital assistant,https://medium.com/@Onecooltip/let-cortana-translate-for-you-e48bd40f7c8d,"arlez-vous Français? Cortana, Microsoft’s personal digital assistant, has been updated in Windows 10 to offer translations in 38 languages Users can ask Cortana to translate via verbal or written requests and Cortana will answer with audio and written replies. To try this yourself, ensure that Cortana is active in Windows 10, then either type your request or say “Hey Cortana”, then “Translate “Word, phrase or sentence you want to to translate” in ‘Language you want to translate to’. Of course, change the request to something like “Translate ‘Where are the bathrooms?’ in Spanish’”. This new capability adds the recently introduced translation capabilities in the Microsoft Skype audio/video chat service. As Cortana improves and expands, this service will be more useful in mobile devices. Enjoy!"
