1,TR10: Intelligent Software Assistant,virtual personal assistant,http://www.morgenthaler.com/press-releases/Siri%20Named%20Top%2010%20Emerging%20Tech%20of%202009.pdf,"Adam Cheyer is leading the design of powerful software that acts as a personal aide.
 By Erica Naone
Search is the gateway to the Internet for most people; for many of us, it has become second
nature to distill a task into a set of keywords that will lead to the required tools and information.
But Adam Cheyer, cofounder of Silicon Valley startup Siri, envisions a new way for people to
interact with the services available on the Internet: a ""do engine"" rather than a search engine. Siri
is working on virtual personal-assistant software, which would help users complete tasks rather
than just collect information.
Cheyer, Siri's vice president of engineering, says that the software takes the user's context into
account, making it highly useful and flexible. ""In order to get a system that can act and reason,
you need to get a system that can interact and understand,"" he says.
Siri traces its origins to a military-funded artificial-intelligence project called CALO, for
""cognitive assistant that learns and organizes,"" that is based at the research institute SRI
International. The project's leaders--including Cheyer--combined traditionally isolated
approaches to artificial intelligence to try to create a personal-assistant program that improves by
interacting with its user. Cheyer, while still at SRI, took a team of engineers aside and built a
sample consumer version; colleagues finally persuaded him to start a company based on the
prototype. Siri licenses its core technology from SRI.
Mindful of the sometimes spectacular failure of previous attempts to create a virtual personal
assistant, Siri's founders have set their sights conservatively. The initial version, to be released
this year, will be aimed at mobile users and will perform only specific types of functions, such as
helping make reservations at restaurants, check flight status, or plan weekend activities. Users
can type or speak commands in casual sentences, and the software deciphers their intent from the
context. Siri is connected to multiple online services, so a quick interaction with it can
accomplish several small tasks that would normally require visits to a number of websites. For
example, a user can ask Siri to find a midpriced Chinese restaurant in a specific part of town and
make a reservation there.
Recent improvements in computer processor power have been essential in bringing this level of
sophistication to a consumer product, Cheyer says. Many of CALO's abilities still can't be
crammed into such products. But the growing power of mobile phones and the increasing speed 
of networks make it possible to handle some of the processing at Siri's headquarters and pipe the
results back to users, allowing the software to take on tasks that just couldn't be done before.
""Search does what search does very well, and that's not going anywhere anytime soon,"" says Dag
Kittlaus, Siri's cofounder and CEO. ""[But] we believe that in five years, everyone's going to have
a virtual assistant to which they delegate a lot of the menial tasks.""
While the software will be intelligent and useful, the company has no aspiration to make it seem
human. ""We think that we can create an incredible experience that will help you be more
efficient in your life, in solving problems and the tasks that you do,"" Cheyer says. But Siri is
always going to be just a tool, not a rival to human intelligence: ""We're very practical minded.""

Weekend Plans
Siri cofounder Tom Gruber volunteered Adam Cheyer to participate in a conversation with the
software (shown above). Gruber explains the artificial-intelligence tasks behind its responses.
1. ""The user can ask a broad question like this because Siri has information that gives clues about
what the user intends. For example, the software might store data about the user's location,
schedule, and past activities. Siri can deal with open-ended questions within specific areas, such
as entertainment or travel.""
2. ""Siri pulls information relevant to the user's question from a variety of Web services and tools.
In this case, it checks the weather, event listings, and directories of local attractions and uses
machine learning to select certain options based on the user's past preferences. Siri can connect
to various Web applications and then integrate the results into a single response.""
3. ""Siri interprets this reply in the context of the existing conversation, using it to refine the user's
request.""
4. ""The software offers specific suggestions based on the user's personal preferences and its
ability to categorize. Because Siri is task-oriented, rather than a search engine, it offers to buy
tickets that the user selects.""
5. ""By now, the conversation has narrowed enough that all the user has to do is click on his
choice.""
6. ""Siri compiles information about the event, such as band members, directions, and prices, and
structures it in a logical way. It also handles the task of finding out what's available and getting
the tickets.""

2,Detecting out-of-domain utterances addressed to a virtual personal assistant,virtual personal assistant,https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2014/i14_0283.html,"Using different sources of information for grammar induction results in grammars that vary in coverage and precision. Fusing such grammars with a strategy that exploits their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses is expected to produce grammars with superior performance. We focus on the fusion of grammars produced using a knowledge-based approach using lexicalized ontologies and a data-driven approach using semantic similarity clustering. We propose various algorithms for finding the mapping between the (non-terminal) rules generated by each grammar induction algorithm, followed by rule fusion. Three fusion approaches are investigated: early, mid and late fusion. Results show that late fusion provides the best relative F-measure performance improvement by 20%."

It will look at examples of intelligent programs with natural language processing that are currently available, with different categories of support, and examine the potential usefulness of one specific piece of software as a VPA. This engages the ability to communicate socially through natural language processing, holding and analysing data within the context of the user. It is suggested that new technologies may soon make the idea of virtual personal assistants a reality. Experiments conducted on this system, combined with user testing, have provided evidence that a basic program with natural language processing algorithms in the form of a VPA, with basic natural language processing and the ability to function without the need for other type of human input (or programming) may already be viable."
4,A model to measure QoE for virtual personal assistant,virtual personal assistant,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-016-3650-5,"Until now the virtual assistants (like Siri, Google Now and Cortana) have primarily been confined to voice input and output only. Is there a justification for voice only confinement or can we enhance the user experience by adding a visual output? We hypothesized that providing a higher level of visual/auditory immersion would enhance the quality of user experience. In order to test this hypothesis, we first developed 4 variants of virtual assistant, each with a different audio/visual level of immersion. Developed virtual assistant systems were the following; audio only, audio and 2D visual display, audio and 3D visual display and audio and immersive 3D visual display. We developed a plan for usability testing of all 4 variants. The usability testing was conducted with 30 subjects against eight (8) dependent variables included presence, involvement, attention, reliability, dependency, easiness, satisfaction and expectations. Each subject rated these dependent variables based on a scale of 1–5, 5 being the highest value. The raw data collected from usability testing was then analyzed through several tools in order to determine the factors contributing towards the quality of experience for each of the 4 variants. The significant factors were then used develop a model that measures the quality of user experience. It was found that each variant had a different set of significant variables. Hence, in order to rate each system there is a need to develop a scale that is dependent upon the unique set of variables for the respective variant. Furthermore, it was found that variant 4 scored the highest rate for Quality of Experience (QoE). Lastly several other qualitative conclusions were also drawn from this research that will guide future work in the field of virtual assistants."
5,Evaluation of a multimodal virtual personal assistant,virtual personal assistant,http://www.academia.edu/download/34253946/35_Branco.pdf,"Nowadays mobility is a reality. The small size and the rising computational power of personal
mobiles devices enable the access and the exchange of an increasingly greater volume of data
and information, anywhere and anytime. Multimodal interfaces, combining voice and visual
modes can simplify the interaction but they raise news challenges concerning the usability and
acceptability of such interfaces.
In this paper, we present the results of the evaluation of a Virtual Personal Assistant
application that provides e-mail management facilities through an intelligent and multimodal
interaction with a fixed or a mobile device. The results show that the quality and speed of the
system feedback as well as the recognition accuracy of the spoken components are key factors
to a better user experience and for the acceptance of multimodal systems. "
6,Interaction design concepts for a mobile personal assistant,virtual personal assistant,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1005232,"The Personal Assistant for onLine Services (PALS) project aims to develop an intelligent interface that facilitates efficient user interaction through personalization and context awareness with commerce web sites on a handheld device. The types of assistance services and interaction support represented by a mobile personal assistant have been investigated in the PALS project. Scenario Based Design was used to develop the PALS framework for the personal assistance services, generic scenarios and a usage model. The service concepts (e.g. direct, solicited, non-solicited, independent) characterize interaction between the user and virtual assistant during mobile web tasks. The generic scenarios and usage model aid to develop design and interaction of the PALS interface. A theme of ""personal customer support"" through an attentive interactive display can aid user acceptance of mobile web task assistance."
7,Understanding user behavior of virtual personal assistant devices,virtual personal assistant,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10257-018-0375-1,"With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the market for virtual personal assistant (VPA) devices is emerging as a new battleground for global information technology companies. This study develops a comprehensive research model, based on perceived value theory, to explain potential customers’ intentions to adopt and use VPA devices. It investigates the relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and product-related characteristics (i.e., portability, automation, and visual attractiveness). The research model and hypotheses are evaluated through Partial least squares analysis, using 313 survey samples. The results show that perceived usefulness and enjoyment have a significant impact on usage intention. Among the three constructs reflecting software- and hardware-based utilitarian value, content quality has the strongest impact on perceived usefulness. From the perspective of hedonic value, content quality, which is also a utilitarian attribute of VPA devices, and visual attractiveness positively affect perceived enjoyment. This study concludes by discussing implications and offering useful suggestions for academia and practice."
8,Towards healthcare personal agents,virtual personal assistant,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2666266,"For a long time, the research on human-machine conversation and interaction has inspired futuristic visions created by film directors and science fiction writers. Nowadays, there has been great progress towards this end by the extended community of artificial intelligence scientists spanning from computer scientists to neuroscientists. In this paper we first review the tension between the latest advances in the technology of virtual agents and the limitations in the modality, complexity and sociability of conversational agent interaction. Then we identify a research challenge and target for the research and technology community. We need to create a vision and research path to create personal agents that are perceived as devoted assistants and counselors in helping end-users managing their own healthcare and well-being throughout their life. Such target is a high-payoff research agenda with high-impact on the society. In this position paper, following a review of the state-of-the-art in conversational agent technology, we discuss the challenges in spoken/multimodal/multi-sensorial interaction needed to support the development of Healthcare Personal Agents."
9, Dangerous skills: Understanding and mitigating security risks of voice-controlled third-party functions on virtual personal assistant systems,virtual personal assistant,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9785/5989936ed45485f15e470f8c70a8a3a1e93c.pdf,"Virtual personal assistants (VPA) (e.g., Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant) today mostly rely on the voice channel to communicate with their users, which however is known to be vulnerable, lacking proper authentication (from the user to the VPA). A new authentication challenge, from the VPA service to the user, has emerged with the rapid growth of the VPA ecosystem, which allows a third party to publish a function (called skill) for the service and therefore can be exploited to spread malicious skills to a large audience during their interactions with smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home. In this paper, we report a study that concludes such remote, large-scale attacks are indeed realistic. We discovered two new attacks: voice squatting in which the adversary exploits the way a skill is invoked (e.g., ``open capital one''), using a malicious skill with a similarly pronounced name (e.g., ``capital won'') or a paraphrased name (e.g., ``capital one please'') to hijack the voice command meant for a legitimate skill (e.g., ``capital one''), and voice masquerading in which a malicious skill impersonates the VPA service or a legitimate skill during the user's conversation with the service to steal her personal information. These attacks aim at the way VPAs work or the user's misconceptions about their functionalities, and are found to pose a realistic threat by our experiments (including user studies and real-world deployments) on Amazon Echo and Google Home. The significance of our findings has already been acknowledged by Amazon and Google, and further evidenced by the risky skills found on Alexa and Google markets by the new squatting detector we built. We further developed a technique that automatically captures an ongoing masquerading attack and demonstrated its efficacy. "
10,The impact of artificial intelligence and virtual personal assistants on marketing,virtual personal assistant,https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-and-virtual-personal-assistants-on-marketing/184275,"This entry will review the state of the art in AI, with a particular focus on applications in marketing. Based on the current capabilities of AI in marketing, the author's explore the new rules of engagement. Rather than simply targeting consumers, the marketing effort will also be directed at the algorithms controlling the consumers' virtual personal assistants (VPAs). Rather than exploiting human desires and weakness, marketing will need to focus on meeting the user's actual needs. The level of customer satisfaction will be even more critical as marketing will need to focus on establishing and maintaining a reputation in competition with those of similar offerings in the marketplace. This entry concludes with thoughts on the long-term implications, exploring the role of customer trust in the adoption of AI agents, the security requirements for agents and the ethical implications of access to such agents."
