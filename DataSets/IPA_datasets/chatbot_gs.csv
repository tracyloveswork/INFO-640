1, Extracting Chatbot Knowledge from Online Discussion Forums.,chatbot ,https://www.aaai.org/Papers/IJCAI/2007/IJCAI07-066.pdf,"This paper presents a novel approach for extracting
high-quality <thread-title, reply> pairs as chat
knowledge from online discussion forums so as to
efficiently support the construction of a chatbot for
a certain domain. Given a forum, the high-quality
<thread-title, reply> pairs are extracted using a
cascaded framework. First, the replies logically
relevant to the thread title of the root message are
extracted with an SVM classifier from all the replies, based on correlations such as structure and
content. Then, the extracted <thread-title, reply>
pairs are ranked with a ranking SVM based on their
content qualities. Finally, the Top-N <thread-title,
reply> pairs are selected as chatbot knowledge. Results from experiments conducted within a movie
forum show the proposed approach is effective."
2,Survey on chatbot design techniques in speech conversation systems,chatbot ,http://repository.essex.ac.uk/21238/,"Human-Computer Speech is gaining momentum as a technique of computer interaction. There has been a recent upsurge in speech based search engines and assistants such as Siri, Google Chrome and Cortana. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as NLTK for Python can be applied to analyse speech, and intelligent responses can be found by designing an engine to provide appropriate human like responses. This type of programme is called a Chatbot, which is the focus of this study. This paper presents a survey on the techniques used to design Chatbots and a comparison is made between different design techniques from nine carefully selected papers according to the main methods adopted. These papers are representative of the significant improvements in Chatbots in the last decade. The paper discusses the similarities and differences in the techniques and examines in particular the Loebner prize-winning Chatbots."
3,Different measurements metrics to evaluate a chatbot system,chatbot ,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1556341,"A chatbot is a software system, which can interact or ""chat"" with a human user in natural language such as English. For the annual Loebner Prize contest, rival chatbots have been assessed in terms of ability to fool a judge in a restricted chat session. We are investigating methods to train and adapt a chatbot to a specific user's language use or application, via a user-supplied training corpus. We advocate open-ended trials by real users, such as an example Afrikaans chatbot for Afrikaans-speaking researchers and students in South Africa. This is evaluated in terms of ""glass box"" dialogue efficiency metrics, and ""black box"" dialogue quality metrics and user satisfaction feedback. The other examples presented in this paper are the Qur'an and the FAQchat prototypes. Our general conclusion is that evaluation should be adapted to the application and to user needs."
4,A deep reinforcement learning chatbot,chatbot ,https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02349,"We present MILABOT: a deep reinforcement learning chatbot developed by the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) for the Amazon Alexa Prize competition. MILABOT is capable of conversing with humans on popular small talk topics through both speech and text. The system consists of an ensemble of natural language generation and retrieval models, including template-based models, bag-of-words models, sequence-to-sequence neural network and latent variable neural network models. By applying reinforcement learning to crowdsourced data and real-world user interactions, the system has been trained to select an appropriate response from the models in its ensemble. The system has been evaluated through A/B testing with real-world users, where it performed significantly better than many competing systems. Due to its machine learning architecture, the system is likely to improve with additional data."
5,A new chatbot for customer service on social media,chatbot ,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025496,"Users are rapidly turning to social media to request and receive customer service; however, a majority of these requests were not addressed timely or even not addressed at all. To overcome the problem, we create a new conversational system to automatically generate responses for users requests on social media. Our system is integrated with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and is trained by nearly 1M Twitter conversations between users and agents from over 60 brands. The evaluation reveals that over 40% of the requests are emotional, and the system is about as good as human agents in showing empathy to help users cope with emotional situations. Results also show our system outperforms information retrieval system based on both human judgments and an automatic evaluation metric."
6,Building a chatbot with serverless computing,chatbot ,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3007217,"Chatbots are emerging as the newest platform used by millions of consumers worldwide due in part to the commoditization of natural language services, which provide provide developers with many building blocks to create chatbots inexpensively. However, it is still difficult to build and deploy chatbots. Developers need to handle the coordination of the cognitive services to build the chatbot interface, integrate the chatbot with external services, and worry about extensibility, scalability, and maintenance. In this work, we present the architecture and prototype of a chatbot using a serverless platform, where developers compose stateless functions together to perform useful actions. We describe our serverless architecture based on function sequences, and how we used these functions to coordinate the cognitive microservices in the Watson Developer Cloud to allow the chatbot to interact with external services. The serverless model improves the extensibility of our chatbot, which currently supports 6 abilities: location based weather reports, jokes, date, reminders, and a simple music tutor."
7,Ontbot: Ontology based chatbot,chatbot ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6149594/,"A new ontology based approach is proposed to model and operate chatbots (OntBot). OntBot uses appropriate mapping technique to transform ontologies and knowledge into relational database and then use that knowledge to drive its chats. The proposed approach overcomes a number of traditional chatbots drawbacks including: the need to learn and use chatbot specific language such as AIML, high botmaster interference, and the use of non-matured technology. OntBot has the additional power of easy users interactions using their natural language, and the seamless support of different application domains. This gives the proposed approach a number of unique scalability and interoperability properties that are going to be evaluated in future phases of this research project."
8,Real conversations with artificial intelligence: A comparison between human–human online conversations and human–chatbot conversations,chatbot ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215001247,"This study analyzed how communication changes when people communicate with an intelligent agent as opposed to with another human. We compared 100 instant messaging conversations to 100 exchanges with the popular chatbot Cleverbot along seven dimensions: words per message, words per conversation, messages per conversation, word uniqueness, and use of profanity, shorthand, and emoticons. A MANOVA indicated that people communicated with the chatbot for longer durations (but with shorter messages) than they did with another human. Additionally, human–chatbot communication lacked much of the richness of vocabulary found in conversations among people, and exhibited greater profanity. These results suggest that while human language skills transfer easily to human–chatbot communication, there are notable differences in the content and quality of such conversations."
9,Using corpora in machine-learning chatbot systems,chatbot ,https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ijcl.10.4.06sha,"A chatbot is a machine conversation system which interacts with human users via natural conversational language. Software to machine-learn conversational patterns from a transcribed dialogue corpus has been used to generate a range of chatbots speaking various languages and sublanguages including varieties of English, as well as French, Arabic and Afrikaans. This paper presents a program to learn from spoken transcripts of the Dialogue Diversity Corpus of English, the Minnesota French Corpus, the Corpus of Spoken Afrikaans, the Qur'an Arabic-English parallel corpus, and the British National Corpus of English; we discuss the problems which arose during learning and testing. Two main goals were achieved from the automation process. One was the ability to generate different versions of the chatbot in different languages, bringing chatbot technology to languages with few if any NLP resources: the corpus-based learning techniques transferred straightforwardly to develop chatbots for Afrikaans and Qur'anic Arabic. The second achievement was the ability to learn a very large number of categories within a short time, saving effort and errors in doing such work manually: we generated more than one million AIML categories or conversation-rules from the BNC corpus, 20 times the size of existing AIML rule-sets, and probably the biggest AI Knowledge-Base ever."
10,Freudbot: An investigation of chatbot technology in distance education,chatbot ,https://www.learntechlib.org/p/20691/,"A chatbot named Freudbot was constructed using the open source architecture of AIML to determine if a famous person application of chatbot technology could improve student-content interaction in distance education. Fifty-three students in psychology completed a study in which they chatted with Freudbot over the web for 10 minutes under one of two instructional sets. They then completed a questionnaire to provide information about their experience and demographic variables. The results from the questionnaire indicated a neutral evaluation of the chat experience although participants positively endorsed the expansion of chatbot technology and provided clear direction for future development and improvement. A basic analysis of the chatlogs indicated a high proportion of on-task behaviour. There was no effect of instructional set. Altogether, the findings indicate that famous person applications of chatbot technology may be promising as a teaching and learning tool in distance and online education.
