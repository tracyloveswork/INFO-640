1,Equivalence checking for comparing user interfaces,zero ui,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2774844,"Plastic User Interfaces (UIs) have the capacity to adapt to changes in their context of use while preserving usability. This exposes users to different versions of UIs that can diverge from each other at several levels, which may cause loss of consistency. This raises the question of similarity between UIs. This paper proposes an approach to comparing UIs by measuring to what extent UIs have the same interaction capabilities and appearance. We use the equivalence checking formal method. The approach verifies whether two UI models are equivalent or not. When they are not equivalent, the UI divergences are listed, thus providing the possibility of leaving them out of the analysis. In this case, the two UIs are said equivalent modulo such divergences. Furthermore, the approach shows that one UI can contain at least all interaction capabilities of another. We apply the approach to a case study in the nuclear power plant domain in which several UI versions are analyzed, and the equivalence and inclusion relations are demonstrated."

Some commentators take the view that chatbot technology will be so disruptive that it will eliminate the need for websites and apps. But chatbots have a long history. So what's new, and what's different this time? And is there an opportunity here to improve how our industry does technology transfer?"
3,Interface Tesseracto UI and the Hologram: A Zero UI Proposal,zero ui,https://www.igi-global.com/article/interface-tesseracto-ui-and-the-hologram/236638,"Building Tesseracto UI-type holographic interfaces is one step significant interaction in interfaces of computational devices with interaction in 3D. This follows the idea that the best user interface is no interface device, in the space of the hypercube and the fourth dimension. The contact device detects haptic interfaces, at the same time the touch in a free space as contact is made from fine ultrasonic sensors corresponding to the hologram images. The prototype was developed using the vertical and horizontal ultrasonic devices and a display hologram. The device is still in the testing phase, but the connection with the computer screens is already possible, in a prototype environment.

2. What Is The Work Of Art As Thing, Virtual Interface And Zero Ui
It also emphasizes that the concept of aesthetics goes beyond all this, and the concepts of form and content “in which everything fits and something”, making the rational as logical and the irrational as allegorical nowadays incorrectly as virtual or even imaginary. The Heidegger points out and must be taken into account, together with Hinton's discourse on Tesseractus, is that “form-matter and the subject-object relationship, then representation has a conceptual mechanics which nothing can resist.” (Heidegger, 2017: 18).

The fundamental question of the distinction between matter and form, when we are treating as mere things, is primarily due to the “dilation and the emptying” of these concepts, that is, the “remission to a vast use”, trying to make them “natural determinations” to work of art.

In order not to miss out on the essential questions, he will say by way of example: “The granite block, which rests on itself, is something material in a well-defined, though coarse form. This form here means the distribution and ordering of the parts of matter in the places of space, which has as consequence a certain outline, namely that of a block “(Heidegger, 2017, p. 19), and he will say at the end of the reasoning the properties and possibilities of granite, that “the being that is submitted is always the product (Erzeugnis) of a fabrication (Anfertigung)” (Heidegger, 2017, p. 29), the product being manufactured as “an accessory for something”.

It which is compatible with Flusser's manufacturing idea (2017), and which translates into an essential concept of artifact (Marcos, Mucheroni, 2018), although there may be subtle distinctions between the three: Heidegger, Flusser and our concept of the artifact."
4,InteractivePaper: Minimalism in Document Editing UI Through the Handwriting Prism,zero ui,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3357099,"The use of the minimalistic design in the document editing UI based on novel handwriting recognition technologies for mobile devices with a touch screen is very limited in real-world applications, mainly due to the propagation of errors made by recognition engines for different types of input. It is caused by the iterative nature of recognition for diverse input. Currently, one of the common ways is to pre-configure the input type manually for different types of documents' content that leads to an increase in UI complexity. Bearing this in mind, we revisit UI design issues regarding the unification of recognition flow by introducing the document layout analyzer, to avoid switching between modes during input of handwritten documents. The system for the iterative input of diverse document by using handwritten strokes recognition techniques was presented. Using an evaluation study, we have shown that the proposed approach provides a more interactive experience for the user and increases the input speed by 1.5--2 times compared to the classical approaches."
5,Eye Drive: Gaze-based semi-autonomous wheelchair interface,zero ui,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8856608/,"Existing wheelchair control interfaces, such as sip & puff or screen based gaze-controlled cursors, are challenging for the severely disabled to navigate safely and independently as users continuously need to interact with an interface during navigation. This puts a significant cognitive load on users and prevents them from interacting with the environment in other forms during navigation. We have combined eyetracking/gaze-contingent intention decoding with computer vision context-aware algorithms and autonomous navigation drawn from self-driving vehicles to allow paralysed users to drive by eye, simply by decoding natural gaze about where the user wants to go: A.Eye Drive. Our ""Zero UI"" driving platform allows users to look and interact visually with at an object or destination of interest in their visual scene, and the wheelchair autonomously takes the user to the intended destination, while continuously updating the computed path for static and dynamic obstacles. This intention decoding technology empowers the end-user by promising more independence through their own agency."
6,The Best Interface For A System,zero ui,https://myassignmenthelp.com/free-samples/the-best-interface-for-a-system,"What does the statement “the best interface for a system is no User interface”? When might this apply and provide examples
The term No User Interface or Zero UI refers to the feature that enables users to have a screen-less experience with their devices. According to (), it can be considered as a great interface design that can make a device more user friendly by which people can complete their tasks more efficiently. Nowadays, people have become more app-obsessed and they always try to use best tools for their jobs. No one wants to go back to the age of flip-phone, everyone needs a smart phone to get immediate solution for their job-related problems (Kumar, Stecher & Tamura 2016, p.1870).   

For example: In this context, it can be stated that, the automobile engineers can use this zero UI concept in solving the transportation problems. With the help of the technological progress the engineers can make a touch-screen central control that helps the driver to look at their way while driving. Another application of this screen-based thinking can be the app, by which people can get relief from swiping their smart phones (Al-Fuqaha, et. al., 2015). As Apple has launched a new app through which people can speak can speak to their screens for clicking a selfie or calling someone. This app may help the users to access the things more easily that they care about."
7,zPots: a virtual pottery experience with spatial interactions using the leap motion device,zero ui,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2574834,"We present zPots, an application for gesture-free hand-based design of virtual pottery enabled by the Leap Motion device. With zPots, a user can shape and color 3D pots by moving bare hands in the air with minimal or no training. Unlike large-space hand-and-body movements required by depth cameras such as the Kinect, the use of the Leap motion device facilitates close range 3D interactions collocated with the personal computer. We demonstrate our application as a synergistic combination of novel spatial interactions and tool metaphors that cater to engaging and realistic experiences while supporting creativity in 3D shape conceptualization and modeling."
8,An adaptation technique for multimedia applications based on the user context to manage the service quality,zero ui,https://avestia.com/MHCI2014_Proceedings/papers/63.pdf,"-Currently, the adaptation of multimedia applications is necessary, because documents can be accessed at
anytime and anywhere with a wide variety of devices, such as PDAs, laptops and tablets. Unfortunately, in most
applications dedicated to this type of problem, are essentially based on the heterogeneity of the data (image, sound,
text, video and encoding format for each type), related to a user context, the context of terminal and network
receiver and transmitter. In this paper. We propose an architecture on-the-fly adaptation of multimedia documents.
More precisely, we propose a procedure that selects the relevant adaptation policies to build a document adapted to
ensure quality of service and to consider the limits users (physical handicap, preferences of users)."
