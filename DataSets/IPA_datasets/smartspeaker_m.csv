1,"Hey Siri, Should I Give My Children Their Own Smart Speaker?
Voice-recognition technology isn’t going anywhere — might as well teach kids to use it responsibly",smart speaker,https://medium.com/s/little-minds-and-big-screens/hey-siri-should-i-give-my-children-their-own-smart-speaker-acf718196ee3,"It has happened: My children want their own smart speakers.
It’s not surprising. I’m a journalist covering tech and music, so I feel obliged to understand these devices that loom large in my work. There’s an Amazon Echo in my home office, an Apple HomePod in the kitchen, and a Google Home Mini in the bedroom.
My sons watch me talking to Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant and quickly follow suit: If they’re not dashing into the office to request “Man’s Not Hot” before running away cackling, they’re enlisting the HomePod to do their math homework or pestering Google with inappropriate questions about bottoms.
The same phenomenon is happening in millions of homes around the world. Research firm Futuresource estimates that 26.6 million smart speakers shipped in 2017, with 89 percent of those sold to Americans and Brits. By January this year, one in six Americans owned a smart speaker. Another research company, Canalys, expects shipments to grow to 56.3 million in 2018 as the competition between Amazon, Google, and Apple heats up.
It’s been fascinating to watch my children’s reaction to smart speakers and their voice-control features. Like many adults — even tech-savvy ones — my mode of interaction is “Alexa?” (or “Hey Siri?” or “Hey Google?”), and then a pause before giving some voice command. It’s a pause that, I think, still signifies disbelief. Can I really talk to a device and have it understand me? Do I need to speak slowly and leave gaps?
There’s no pause when my children speak to a smart speaker. It’s a small difference, but noteworthy because of their confidence. Even toddlers can work out a touchscreen interface. They’re not thinking about the interaction with technology: They’re just doing it.
And now they want to do it with their own smart speakers. It’s not just because I’m a bit touchy about them talking to “my” speakers, whether it’s messing up my Spotify recommendations or teaching Google’s advertising algorithms that I have a keen and regularly voiced interest in “smelly bums” and “big poos.”
No, my sons want a device of their own that responds to their voice commands, and they only see the good in this. Which is where I come in as the big bad parent, fretting about privacy and personal data on their behalf. And, yes, this as a man who sleeps two feet from a Google-made listening device.
No Mattel, My Children Are Not “Assets”
Concerns around children and smart speakers have already blown up into a controversy. In 2017, Mattel unveiled a device called Aristotle that promised parents it would “use the most advanced AI-driven technology to make it easier for them to protect, develop, and nurture the most important asset in their home — their children.”
That included the ability to teach ABCs and 1-2-3s to toddlers, help slightly older children with their homework and play music or voice-controlled games, and teach foreign languages to tweens, among other features.
By the autumn, a 15,000-signature petition organized by two U.S. groups, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) and the Story of Stuff Project, was calling for Mattel to can the Aristotle before it even went on sale, while U.S. politicians were asking the company pointed questions about what data the speaker would be gathering on its young users and how it would be stored and shared.
“This new product has the potential to raise serious privacy concerns as Mattel can build an in-depth profile of children and their family. It appears that never before has a device had the capability to so intimately look into the life of a child,” the petition stated. Less than a fortnight later, Mattel canceled the device.
Since then, the CCFC has continued its efforts to call out devices and toys that may infringe children’s privacy, from smartwatches and robot companions to Facebook’s plans for a Messenger Kids app for families to use for chatting.
If we’re worried about smart devices made for children, shouldn’t we be even more worried about children using devices meant for adults? Yet both Amazon and Google have explicitly positioned their smart speakers as family friendly devices through the “skills” (Amazon) and “actions” (Google) that are these devices’ equivalent of smartphone apps.
In August 2017, Amazon launched a series of “kid skills”for its Alexa voice-assistant and Echo speakers, working with Sesame Street, Nickelodeon, and other companies to create them. Parental consent was part of the process of getting them to work; by October, the company was offering a $250,000 prize fund for developers who made the best examples.
Google followed suit in October 2017, releasing more than 50 children’s games, activities, and stories for its Google Assistant and Google Home, inviting kids to say, “OK Google. Play Mickey Mouse Adventure / Talk to What’s My Justice League Super Hero / Play Sports Illustrated Kids Trivia,” and other actions.
My, Um, Parenting Strategy
I’m fascinated by the potential of all this: family games (there’s already an educational board game where Alexa plays compère), interactive stories, and learning experiences, for example. There will be developers who have made it their mission to ignite children’s imaginations through voice-controlled experiences, and I’d love my boys to be able to benefit.
I also have a creeping sense that voice, as much as touch, will be a very important interface in the future. Isn’t it a good thing if my sons are learning how to interact with these kinds of devices now to prepare them for whatever machines they’ll be speaking to as adults? Preparation can also involve learning about how these devices’ privacy settings work and how the tech companies behind them deal with our personal data.
For this parent, that starts with learning those lessons myself. I recommend starting with this Wired article about what Echo and Google Home do with your voice data, or this Gizmodo piece about locking down privacy settings on your devices. CNET has a good primer on HomePod settings to change if you have one in a family setting.
Getting on top of the privacy settings, and then exploring what these smart speakers and their skills/actions can do with my children — rather than simply buying them a bedroom device and letting them figure it out — is the path I’ve chosen for now.
This is part of my slightly fuzzy parenting strategy where there are some things I don’t want my kids doing on their own just yet, but I want to talk about and experience them together ahead of that time to encourage healthy (and sometimes skeptical) attitudes toward technology on their part.
It’s the same with Snapchat and Instagram: apps my sons are still too young for, yet they know and are curious about them. Rather than a blanket don’t-even-mention-them ban on these apps, I’m showing them my feeds, letting them play with the filters and silly effects, and talking about how these apps work and some of the pitfalls to avoid — from judging your value by your number of likes to having snaps go public that you thought were private.
It takes time and effort, but that’s been my experience with pretty much everything when it comes to responsible parenting.
So, sorry, kids, no smart speaker by your bedside just yet. But this is a new technology we will continue to experience together as it develops and have the conversations that will hopefully help you make the right decisions about these devices as you grow older."
2,"Sonos’s Secret Weapon In The Smart Speaker Wars: Becoming A Platform
As tech titans release familiar-looking smart speakers, Sonos is hoping to set itself apart by opening its sound system up to developers–and giving users more freedom.",smart speaker,https://medium.com/fast-company/sonoss-secret-weapon-in-the-smart-speaker-wars-becoming-a-platform-2736fb05c225,"Barely two hours after the stage lights dimmed at Sonos’s product launch event in New York last week, the speaker company’s products had yet another new competitor. The Google Home Max, a high-quality speaker and just one of several smart gadgets announced later that day, may be Google’s voice-powered answer to Apple’s HomePod and Amazon’s new higher-quality Echo, but it also takes aim the wireless home audio turf long dominated by Sonos.
It’s not the first time the 15-year-old wireless home audio company has felt tech giants inch closer to its territory. The successful 2014 launch of the Amazon Echo–despite its lower-quality audio and lack of support for multi-room playback–seemed to catch Sonos (along with many others) by surprise. The following year, the company announced a round of layoffs, heightened its focus on paid streaming music services, and vowed to add voice control to its line of speakers.
Despite the proliferating threats (from much bigger companies, no less), Sonos doesn’t seem panicked. That’s because even as titans like Google and Amazon vie to become its newest competitors, those companies — along with many others — are also forging another relationship with Sonos: Partners. That might seem odd. But as the voice-controlled smart speaker war of 2017 kicks into high gear, Sonos is hoping to set itself apart with a new strategy: It’s becoming a platform. By the end of this year, Sonos says it expects to add 50 new developer partners (including many smart home products) to its platform. In 2018, it will open things up to all developers.
“You have no idea what people are going to build,” says Antoine Leblond, VP of software development at Sonos. “When Apple opened iOS, the first thing people made was the fart app.”
While it may be tempting to envision high-fidelity, multi-room fart gags (and an open developer platform certainly doesn’t rule out the possibility), the more practical scenarios likely involve developers connecting Sonos to other smart home devices and coming up with creative new ways to pipe music throughout one’s home. Perhaps your connected doorbell can be amplified in different rooms so you don’t miss a package delivery (and maybe it plays a song–would “Ring My Bell” be too much? — in lieu of the classic ding-dong sound). Maybe your speakers can sync with your lights, or a software developer might make a new alarm clock app that uses your Sonos speakers to fill your bedroom with sounds a bit more soothing than the iPhone marimba chime. For now, the details of the software development tools and options Sonos plans to offer are limited, but it’s easy to imagine some of the possibilities.
However things may eventually evolve, the early days of Sonos’s platform are focused primarily on enabling partnerships with music services and voice-control partners.
The Sonos One speaker announced by the company last week, which will ship with Alexa voice control built in, is its first foray into voice-controlled hardware. And for people who already own Sonos speakers, a new integration with Alexa devices like the Echo and Echo Dot brings Amazon’s voice control to the whole line of Sonos speakers as well. For now, Sonos’s Alexa integration is in beta, and thus has its limitations (it doesn’t yet support voice-controlled playback via Spotify, for instance, although the company says that’s coming very soon).

The voice control ambitions of the Sonos One won’t stop with Alexa. Next year, Sonos will support Google Assistant voice control as well. So even as Sonos’s products and the tech giants’ smart speakers start to resemble each other more and more, Sonos is hoping to set itself apart by giving customers something bigger companies often won’t: Choices. In this case, that means a choice of one’s preferred voice control service (rather than being locked into one). But that’s clearly just the start.
The company is also adding AirPlay 2 support to its speakers, allowing customers to bypass Sonos’s proprietary app for queueing music on its system (and also stream a much wider selection of audio beyond music services). This might seem like a strange thing to tout in an age when Bluetooth speakers allow us to stream any sound from any Bluetooth-enabled device. But Sonos, with its own method of piping multi-room audio over Wi-Fi and a focus on high sound quality, has always turned up its nose at Bluetooth, much to the chagrin of some customers.
“We had a very closed experience, frankly,” says Leblond. “We’ve now moved to a world where now people want a lot of different mechanisms for being able to control their Sonos systems. It’s all about just fitting into people’s lives.”
For Sonos, it’s also about fending off competition that seems to grow–well, in this case, literally by the hour. The competitive rationale for giving users more choice and freedom is what drove Sonos to build a developer platform in the first place. Last year, it worked with Spotify to add the ability to stream music from directly within the Spotify app (just as it had done in 2013 with the much less popular Google Play Music app). With that experience fine-tuned and the underlying development platform complete, Sonos is now ready to expand native streaming support to more music apps, starting with Tidal, Pandora, and iHeartRadio. Again, it’s seemingly a no-brainer, but this isn’t how Sonos has worked traditionally: To control music on the system, you had use Sonos’s own app, which connects to multiple music services. The Sonos controller app is still alive and well (in fact, it just got a significant redesign, amid all the other product news announced Tuesday); but it’s quickly becoming just one of many ways to control Sonos.
The Allure Of Being Agnostic
By opening up its platform, Sonos is aiming to become a more agnostic and flexible sound system for the home — and, it hopes, offer a stark contrast from the similar-looking speakers now being peddled by deeper-pocketed companies. Enticed by those super-affordable Echo gadgets? Go for it, but you can only use Alexa (which is, unsurprisingly, optimized to work best with Amazon’s music service). You want a HomePod? Great. You’ll have to play by Apple’s (and Siri’s) rules and stomach its limitations. Eyeing a Google Assistant? Same deal (although, to its credit, Google has moved quickly to make its voice-control tech available to third-party hardware makers). With Sonos, you can pick and choose your music services, control mechanisms, and whatever else developers start cooking up. And more often than not, it will sound better.
This is by no means a recipe for slam-dunk success. After all, Alexa is a platform too, with thousands of integrations. And Apple’s consumer footprint and marketing prowess alone can make it a threatening competitor. But as the AI-enabled smart speaker space heats up over the next few years, Sonos is hoping to protect its turf using a unique blend of sonic quality, flexibility, and user freedom. It’s a compelling enough message for consumers. It’s just a question of how easily they’ll hear it."

4,"What is a radio, anyway? And what’s a smart speaker?",smart speaker,https://medium.com/@JamesCridland/what-is-a-radio-anyway-and-whats-a-smart-speaker-115e216f0d60,"I rather like this tweet, from the UK industry group Radiocentre, which does a very good job of explaining radio’s multiplatform nature:

It’s a succinctly made point; and highlights a failing in the English language — radio means, of course, three different things — a receiver, a technology, and a type of audio programming.
Radio is now on a variety of different platforms. Broadcast technology, like FM or DAB+; live streaming via IP; and on-demand too, in the form of podcasting and other things.
Most, if not all, radio research reflects this. The apparent unsophistication of a paper diary or a web form is actually quite a useful way of understanding how people listen: since it works with every form of radio, not just something delivered on a speaker.
Fewer people are buying radio receivers than ever before. Yet, in most markets, more people are listening to radio than ever before — because radio is not a platform, it’s a thing. I define it as “audio with a shared experience and a human connection”.
If we have trouble with defining a “radio”, what about a “smart speaker”, I wonder?
In Q1 2018, the Amazon Echo sold 2.5m devices worldwide; but Google Home sold 3.2m devices in the same time period. It’s the first time that Google has out-sold Amazon for smart speakers.
But that doesn’t tell the whole story, though: Google’s voice assistant works with over 5,000 devices. My JBL Link speaker that is on my deck has Google Assistant built-in; but it isn’t a Google Home. Where does it fit in the figures?
The GPS I use in the car has Google Assistant built-in (very good for sending text messages). The Bose headphones that I take travelling, or the smaller bud headphones I wear on the bus, both have Google Assistant on them as well — I walked over the William Jolly Bridge in Brisbane the other day, asking Google about my diary for tomorrow.
And of course, my mobile phone has Google Assistant in it, too. If it’s on the table, seemingly switched off, “OK, Google, what’s in the news?” will play me a short news bulletin. Or, “Hey, Google, ask Podnews for the latest” starts a conversation with my Podnews podcasting news website.
So, you can compare sales of Amazon Echo vs Google Home if you like; but that misses great swathes of the smart speaker ecosystem.
And you can define radio as a speaker in a box that picks up FM if you like; but that, too, misses much of what your audience already calls radio.
Your challenge is to ensure that your radio output sounds great — whatever ‘radio’ it is playing on."
5,"How music will help the smart speaker soar—and vice versa
These voice-activated, Internet-enabled speakers, most popular for streaming music, have become Pandora’s fastest-growing consumer electronics product. The U.S. could have about 60 million VA smart speaker users by 2021.",smart speaker,https://medium.com/@glennpeoples/how-music-will-help-the-smart-speaker-soar-and-vice-versa-8ef5b73ecfc4,"In fewer than three years, the smart speaker has gone from head-scratcher to head-turner. Along the way, this device has brought artificial intelligence and voice commands into millions of American homes. Usually called voice-activated (VA) smart speakers, they’re often found in the living room or kitchen, taking commands and providing answers like a talking search engine with a surprising sense of humor.
Most importantly to the music industry, these compact appliances excel at playing music. A new report by Edison Research shows 58 percent of VA smart speaker owners had listened to music for an average of 4 hours 34 minutes in the previous week, and 65 percent said they are listening to more music since buying a smart speaker. The latter metric is especially encouraging. Here in the streaming era, the music industry’s most important metric has become engagement. The more often streaming services can engage with listeners, the more revenue will flow to rights holders and artists.
Pandora’s experience confirms Edison’s findings. In the second quarter, 1.6 million active users of VA smart speakers fueled a 282-percent gain in listening time over the same period in 2016. The overall consumer electronics segment had an exceptional quarter, with active users growing 23 percent to 9.7 million, with one in 10 of those users new to Pandora.

Market penetration (% of population) of VA smart speakers will increase in the coming years. But keep in mind many households will have two or more of the devices.
Expect more growth in the coming years. eMarketer forecasts 58.9 million people in the U.S. will be VA smart speaker users by the end of 2020, a 178-percent increase from 15.6 million in 2016. (Separately, Gartner believes that by 2020 VA smart speakers will reach $2.1 billion in global sales and 3.3 percent of the world’s households.) Pandora will be ready. As Pandora chief financial officer (and interim chief executive officer) Naveen Chopra explained in the July 31st earnings call, Pandora believes it is “well-positioned and well-integrated” to capture engagement growth in smart speakers and other connected devices.
These speakers have the kind of wow factor that comes just a few times each decade. Free of using hands, you can ask the VA smart speaker for movie times, a weather forecast, the capital of Minnesota, or events on a calendar (they’re also called virtual personal assistant-enabled wireless speakers). As Amazon’s Echo, “What’s your favorite band?” and you might get the reply, “I like Daft Punk. It’s good time dance music.” They connect to other smart home products, too, allowing voice commands to perform functions like setting a thermostat or turning lights off and on.
Audio is the leading factor for buying a smart speaker. About 47 percent of Echo and Google Home buyers like their smart speaker because it plays music and books, according to a new report by Voicelabs, a data and analytics company that provides makers of voice-activated devices insights into listener behavior. Just 29 percent of buyers like their speakers for the control of smart home devices.
To listen to Pandora on a VA speaker, you can ask the device to play a particular Pandora station. The owner of an Echo might say, “Alexa, play my Paul Simon Radio station on Pandora.” (Other devices use similar phrases. Google Home uses the familiar prompt, “OK Google” when giving a command.) If you like a song, say, “Alexa, thumb this song” and Pandora will retain the feedback. To skip, say, “Alexa, skip this song.” If you want to know the artist or song title, say, “Alexa, what is this song?” And if you request an artist station that’s not in your collection, Alexa will offer to create it for you.
The quick ascent of the VA smart speaker is causing companies to re-think how a person engages with music in a voice-only environment. What happens when people aren’t scrolling through an MP3 collection, choosing from one of dozens or hundreds of playlists, or picking a CD to play on the home stereo? Recalling something specific can be tough. Pandora has a great option: when you can’t think of something to play, say “Alexa, play Thumbprint Radio,” the station built on all the tracks a person has thumbed (liked) since registering.
This little device has come a long way in a short amount of time.
Although it’s turning into a must-have gadget, the VA smart speaker got off to an unceremonious start. The press gave Amazon’s Echo, the first of its kind on the market, a tepid reception when it debuted — completely unannounced — in November, 2014. TechCrunch called the Echo “a tad baffling” and “a crazy speaker that talks to you” in its article. Even a veteran Forrester analyst believed Amazon could be “setting the table for a party that consumers aren’t ready to join.”
But consumers got it. Following the popularity of the Echo, now there are handfuls of voice-activated devices for the home. Google Home, Apple’s upcoming HomePod, and Microsoft’s Invoke connect to other smart devices — lights, thermostat, window shades, even the front door lock — in addition to playing music. A long line of voice-activated speakers are now on the market: Ivee Sleek, Voice Pod, Athom Homey, Omaker WoW, Eufy Genie, Jam Voice, and Lenovo Smart Assistant (powered by Harman/Kardon), to name just a handful.
Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of VA smart speakers is their youth. “It’s still very early,” said Larry Rosen, president of Edison Research. Indeed, the product category has not even reached its second birthday, and each device will have numerous iterations and improvements. More consumers will buy devices when prices drop and awareness increases. Today’s owners are just the tip of the spear, so to speak. “In general, as you might imagine, they’re early adopters,” Rosen added.
Another encouraging finding came from a different Edison Research study: 57 percent of VA smart speakers subscribe to a music service, and 28 percent of all owners said their device led them to become a subscriber. This is a familiar dynamic. Just as the iPhone became a launching pad for music streaming services, the VA smart speaker can become a new gateway for streaming services to reach potential subscribers.
The smart speakers studied by Edison are not to be confused with the more familiar small, portable, Bluetooth-enabled speakers popularized by Beats by Dr. Dre, the now-defunct Jawbone, Bose, JBL, and many others. There are no “smarts” to those speakers, no ability to receive voice commands, perform functions or “speak” in a genial tone of voice.
Nor is smart speaker’s AI the technology that super-entrepreneur Elon Musk has called “a fundamental existential risk for human civilization” and famed theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking warned, “could spell the end of the human race.” It’s not on par with the evil HAL 9000 computer in the movie 2001 or the operating system Joaquin Phoenix dated in the movie Her — not yet, at least. Yes, today’s in-home speaker has “intelligence” beyond other household products. But no, these speakers aren’t going to steal American jobs or evolve intelligence that surpasses humans. They’ll be great for music, though.
Smart homes have been part of Americans’ consciousness for decades. In Star Trek, The Jetsons and Back to the Future II, Hollywood’s depiction of the future has foreseen the use of voice commands in the home (or spacecraft). Voice commands aren’t science fiction, they’re real, and they can help push open the door to tomorrow’s music industry."
6,"Smart Speakers are having their 2004 iPod moment
Ways to think about content strategy for Google Home, Amazon Echo, and Apple HomePod.",smart speaker,https://blog.pacific-content.com/smart-speakers-are-having-their-2004-ipod-moment-83df7c91bc46,"iPods → Podcasting
The year was 2004. The iPod had been out for 3 years. Loads of people were using it to play their music. And then… podcasting suddenly emerged onto the scene.
I remember hearing about Adam ‘The Podfather’ Curry and his podcast, ‘The Daily Source Code’ in the fall of 2004 and being intrigued. Most of the shows were very meta — they were all about podcasting, how it worked, how to do it, how to find ‘podsafe music,’ etc. I was listening to the creation of an entirely new medium that democratized the creation and distribution of audio content.
And what happens when, thanks to new technology, you no longer need a broadcast gatekeeper to fund and distribute your show idea? New forms of shows and content emerge. (For podcasting, it was the ‘two dudes in a basement talking for a LONG time’ format :-) )
Smart Speakers → ???
2018 feels like Smart Speaker version of 2004 for iPods. Technology has again emerged that is replacing another set of audio devices — smart speakers are often replacing traditional radios in the home. And much like the original iPod, the primary use of a smart speaker is… to play music.
Many wonder why podcasts are not thriving on smart speakers. My aim is to explain why podcasts (the way they are formatted currently) may not be right for what people want and need from a smart speaker.
Let’s start with the research. These are sales projections for smart speakers in 2018:

Canalys research on Smart Speaker adoption.
There are going to be close to 100 million of these devices in homes by the end of this year and there is not yet a killer app outside of playing music. And yet they are ALL audio devices — this is a problem in search of a solution. This is the 2018 equivalent of the iPod waiting for the podcast to be invented.
So apart from music, what ARE people using these new devices for currently?

Research from NPR and Edison’s Smart Audio Report 2018
There is nothing ground-breaking in here yet. Foreground listening(i.e. that requires your full ‘foreground’ attention) is short and utility-based. Background listening (i.e. that can play in the background while your full attention is focused on another task like writing emails) is traditional music and radio based. Most current podcasts demand your full ‘foreground’ attention, but they are not short and they are generally not utility-based.
So… there is a big opportunity for a new type of programming perfectly suited for the ways people use smart speakers.
It’s also important to look at when and why people use their smart speakers.

Research from NPR and Edison’s Smart Audio Report 2018
Seeing how smart speakers are used as part of daily routines, it becomes very clear why traditional podcasts are a challenge on smart speakers. Where would a 30–60 minute podcast fit? Everything until 7pm is short-form and utility-focused. Only after 7pm do games and children’s stories come into play. And after 9pm is the first sign of any adult-focused storytelling — interestingly enough through audiobooks and not through podcasts.
So what are the new opportunities? Audio content producers need to start thinking about routines and how to create content that maps to those routines.
In the morning, what are people looking for when they are first waking up, making breakfast, or leaving home for school or work?
In the evening, what types of content are suited to relaxing, preparing for the next day, getting ready for bed or falling asleep?
You need only look at the runaway success of The Daily from the New York Times to see how valuable becoming part of a morning routine can be. There are certainly other hits based on routines waiting to be developed.
Similar to routines, locations matter, too. A lot of current podcast listening is solitary activity that takes place with headphones or in cars. Smart speakers, though, are placed in rooms in your house. This is a fundamentally different context for listening. What type of audio appeals to groups of people instead of individuals? And how does the room of the house affect the type of content that would be valued?

Research from NPR and Edison’s Smart Audio Report 2018
There are new questions that audio content creators need to start thinking about if we want to find the killer apps for smart speakers. What types of content would work best in the kitchen? The living room? The bedroom? And god forbid, the bathroom?
Conclusions
Based on the data, it seems like there are several new content opportunities for smart speakers:
1. Routine-based content.
Content designed to become part of one of your routines, from a morning horoscope or sports summary to a ‘go to sleep’ meditation routine.
If you’re a brand, is there a morning or evening information update you can provide that people would value? (i.e. if you’re a financial institution, are you publishing a short finance/market update every morning?)
The key here is to be short, valuable, and either daily or weekly.
2. Concise, evergreen answers to common questions.
What are the questions that you want to be the answer to? Can you produce something better and more valuable than a Voice Assistant reading from Wikipedia?
It could be location specific queries: (‘How do I use an Instapot?’ in the kitchen or ‘What’s my BMI?’ in the bathroom.)
3. Interactive content for social environments or particular contexts.
Party-games or trivia games for families in living rooms.
Interactive cooking lessons in the kitchen.
Potty-training game for toddlers in the bathroom. 💩
4. Original longer-form background listening ‘stations’
Create a radio station format that doesn’t exist yet and make it specific for the location in the house — a cooking/foodie radio station for example.
Create a personalized radio station that allows users to insert elements from traditional radio like news, weather and traffic at the times of the morning they want them, mixed with their own Spotify or Apple Music playlists.
These are just a few starter ideas and I’m sure everyone reading this can up with dozens more.
What’s clear to me is that much like the iPod in 2004, we are in very early stages of the smart speaker revolution and there are huge opportunities for fresh new content formats that are designed for the contexts in which people use these devices.
What would you like to hear on your smart speaker that hasn’t been invented yet?"

And how listening to Scout FM seamlessly between your apps and Alexa is easy, and kinda magical.",smart speaker,https://notes.subcast.com/im-starting-to-think-this-smart-speaker-thing-is-going-to-be-big-9eab903f1e52,"Do you remember trying to explain to a flip phone user why they should get a smart phone? I distinctly remember trying to tell my brother how having Google maps on your phone means that you never have to get lost again. He said “I’m perfectly happy with what I have,” though he did capitulate a few years later. Fast forward 10 years — do you think he’d go back to that flip phone? No. No he wouldn’t.
Similarly, trying to explain to someone who doesn’t have a smart speaker why they should get one is usually futile, so I don’t push very hard right now. To be honest, they aren’t very smart yet, and have limited functionality. But like smart phones, they’ll grow up.
Why do I think that? First, Amazon is hiring thousands of engineers to work on the platform and there is a war going on between Amazon and Google. Second, we’re seeing firsthand in our user research how people are integrating Alexa into their lives in a meaningful way. Third, the latest SmartAudio report from NPR and Edison Research backs up our anecdotal research, and usually blows the minds of skeptics. Check this out:
One-in-six Americans (16%) now owns a voice-activated smart speaker. 7% of Americans received a smart speaker over the holidays.
After just three years on the market, consumer adoption of smart speakers is tracking slightly ahead of smartphone adoption a decade ago.
65% say that they wouldn’t want to go back to life without their smart speaker.
This is before smart speakers have made it all the way into your cars and into your headphones (though the assistants are on their way). They are only in your home or office, but already they are proving invaluable to the people who optimize their lives with them.

Alexa in every room!
If you have one of these smart speakers, then you are probably thinking about how cool you are right now. Way to be ahead of the curve! If that’s you, then congratulations.
If you have have the most popular smart speaker — one of the many variations of Amazon’s Alexa — then I have a really cool thing you should try. You can listen to 25 of our personalized podcast radio stations on Alexa in your bedroom, then on your phone on the way out the door, then on your phone in your car, and then back on Alexa in your kitchen without missing a syllable.
For the curious, here’s a quick how-to.
1. Download the Scout FM iOS or Android app
You know the drill. We’re in Apple App Store & Google Play.

The home screen of the Scout FM apps has a directory of all of our stations. We’ve got a ton of stations like Learn Something, History, People Stories, Business Builders, Daily News, Conservative Politics… look around and find one you love.
2. Tap the “+Alexa” button on your favorite station
Any station that has a corresponding Alexa station has a small button that says “+Alexa”. Tap that. Now you’re in the connection flow.
3. Enable the skill for your favorite station with a voice command
Next, you’ll see the instructions on how to enable the skill (apps on Alexa are called “skills”). You can do it with your voice. Just say “Alexa, enable Learn Something Radio” (or whichever station you are enabling).



4. Ask Alexa nicely for the code
Then, you’re going to ask Alexa for a code. Just say “Alexa, ask Learn Something Radio to connect.” Alexa will give you a four digit code. This is how we figure out that the Alexa and the phone belong to the same person.
5. Enter the code
BOOM! That’s it. You are now connected. All of your episode progress, you favorites, and your “trashes” are now everywhere you go. It’s like magic.

You might not have thought you needed this in your life, but once you use it you’ll be annoyed at any app that doesn’t do this.
Alexa cheat sheet
I’m sure you are an Alexa expert by now, but just in case you aren’t, here’s a cheat sheet for how to use audio apps on Alexa, and a few Subcast-specific commands.
“Alexa, enable Learn Something radio” enables the skill and makes it work on your Alexa.
“Alexa, open Learn Something radio” starts a session. We just start playing.
“Alexa, next” goes from one episode on the station to the next.
“Alexa, previous” goes to the previous episode.
“Alexa, repeat” goes back 30 seconds.
“Alexa, stop” makes her stop.
“Alexa, resume” picks right back up again.
“Alexa, tell Learn Something Radio I love this” is the same as 💜
“Alexa, tell Learn Something Radio I hate this” is the same as 🗑️
You can find us at subcast.com, on Alexa, iOS, and Android, and on the Twitter at @subcasthq. Happy Listening!

Did you know that you can enable Alexa skills verbally? Just say the command! “Alexa, Open Scout FM”"
8,"Announcing Scout FM: a native podcast listening experience for smart speakers
Why we believe voice assistants hold the key to mainstream podcast listening.",smart speaker,https://medium.com/scout-fm/announcing-scout-fm-a-native-podcast-listening-experience-for-smart-speakers-8c6314537640,"Two incredible things happened at the end of 2014.
First, on October 3rd, 2014, the first episode of Serial aired on This American Life. “The Alibi” had the perfect combination of dramatic story telling, a compelling cliff-hanger, and the high production values you would expect from the This American Life team. At the end of the episode, Ira Glass directed listeners to the next episode that was available immediately, as a podcast. A nation was hooked. Years later, Serial is still the gateway podcast for many new listeners.
Second, Amazon shipped it’s first Amazon Echo. Their previous hardware project, the Fire Phone, was a total bomb and the company needed to redeem itself. While Google and Apple were focused on smart phone domination, Amazon released the Echo and quickly found it’s way under Christmas trees and into people’s homes. The Echo was more successful than anyone could have expected, including people inside of Amazon. Two long years later Google to came out with their own smart speaker, and eventually Apple followed suit.
Fast-forward to 2018. Where are we today?
Between 2014 and 2018, the percentage of Americans who listen to podcasts weekly went from 10% to 17% — a large increase, but still not mainstream. The money brought in by advertising has reached $300M and is still climbing. More importantly, all of that money and the ready user base has attracted industry professionals who make tightly edited, narrative audio stories with high production values. Every week, there is a hot, new show brought to us by professional journalists like The New York Times, Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and ESPN. Podcast networks, like Gimlet and Wondery, have raised money to fuel experimentation with new formats and hire great talent. And a slew of startups (including ours) have taken venture capital to innovate in the space.
Meanwhile, 18% of Americans now own a smart speaker. If you didn’t already know that, pick your jaw up off the floor. The adoption rate is faster than for smart phones. There are more than 40,000 Alexa skills (like apps, but for Alexa), and 74% of Alexa owners use Alexa weekly. Amazon has almost 80% market share, but no one is counting Google out just yet. Just last quarter, they surpassed Amazon in smart speaker sales as international sales ramp up.
Scout FM started as an experiment.
When we started Scout FM (codename: Subcast) in 2017 we knew three things:
We were in a Golden Age of Radio.
Despite podcast growth, not enough people were listening to them.
Smart speakers were going to be huge, and they were perfect for listening to audio.
76% of smart speakers owners used them to listen to music. Nearly 50% used them to listen to the radio. To us, smart speakers were the reincarnation of the home radio, but without the limitations of terrestrial radio. Meanwhile, podcasts filled a gap left by minimal talk radio offerings, particularly in between the coasts, which was exactly where smart speakers were starting to proliferate. We started to wonder if podcasts could ride the coattails of smart speakers right into people’s homes. We started to experiment.
Our first Alexa skill was Game of Thrones Radio. It debuted three weeks before the season finale aired. We took the RSS feeds from ten different Game of Thrones podcasts and strung the episodes together. When users said, “Open Game of Thrones Radio,” Alexa would welcome you, and then play hours and hours of Game of Thrones podcasts.
Game of Thrones Radio was a modest success. When you searched “Game of Thrones” in the Alexa skill store, it ranked second. It had 500 users in the first week. What was more remarkable was how people were listening. They would binge for hours on shows they had never heard before. This behavior was promising.
Since that first skill, we’ve launched another thirty skills for Alexa and accrued more than 1.5 million minutes listened. We’ve experimented with formats, topics, genres, voices, intros, skill store optimizations… some things worked, and others were total disasters. The most effective improvements have involved incorporating real humans into the experience. We hand-curated stations, hired voice actors to record bot interactions, and wrote Alexa-friendly episode descriptions to replicate how a radio host would introduce each upcoming episode. We then layered in a recommendation engine so listeners can benefit from personalization. Listening each month went up 20% per month on average, with Alexa session times that were twice as long as in our apps.
We also started to get to know our listeners. We played an audio ad asking people to visit our website to join a paid study. We got respondents from all over the country. Here are a few of my favorites:
Jessica is a 21-year-old who moved to Florida for the sun. She works as a project manager for a sports team. Her Alexa was a gift. Every morning, she listens to music or “something nerdy” (our History station) while getting ready for work. She listens again before bed to unwind.
Nathan is a 47-year-old farmer from northern California. He bought an Alexa to control his sprinklers. He listens to our Daily News or Science stations after he does his chores in the morning. Note: farmer’s mornings start at 3:30am. I asked what he listened to before he found our stations on his Alexa. “Nothing,” he said.
Bobby is a 54-year-old music instructor from Oklahoma. He listens to Brain Food at home, and while driving between lessons. I asked what he listened to before our stations. “I hate to admit this, but Rush Limbaugh.” He explained that he didn’t actually like Rush, but there weren’t many options where he lived.
What do each of these listeners have in common? Prior to getting their Alexa, they didn’t listen to podcasts. Now they do.
Scout FM is launching today, but is just the beginning.

Scout FM, launching today!
Today, we’re launching Scout FM on Alexa: the first voice-first podcast listening experience. It’s not just a way to access podcasts via a smart speaker. It’s a podcast listening experience designed specifically for a voice assistant world. Instead of having dozens of stations, there will be one — Scout FM. Its mission: to find you something good to listen to. It’s simple with limited options and nothing memorize. Because Alexa skills need to be simple. The smarts and complexity are behind the scenes.
Scout FM rolls up all of the learnings from our Alexa experimentation, and this is just the beginning. We plan to keep experimenting, learning, improving our recommendations, evolving as the platforms evolve, and being wherever voice assistants are — which we predict will be everywhere."
9,Kaleido Insights Impact Analysis on Smart Speakers,smart speaker,https://medium.com/@jowyang/kaleido-insights-impact-analysis-on-smart-speakers-a0ea10ba4fb3,"We put them in our homes. We speak to them, listen to them, buy things from them. Much ado about smart speakers, but what are the implications for consumers and end users?
Kaleido Insights’ methodology for analyzing emerging technology assesses the impacts on humans, on businesses, and on the ecosystem. As part of our ongoing coverage, we’ll be covering a series of topics using our methodology to help business leaders first understand, and then see beyond the bright and shiny and cut right to what matters.
In each post, all Kaleido Insights analysts conduct a joint analysis session around one topic (i.e. technology, event, announcement, etc.) We begin with analyzing the human impacts of smart speakers.
Topic: Smart Speakers
Examples: Amazon Echo, Google Home, Sonos One, Apple Homepod, among many others
Impact Analysis: Humans (consumers and end users)

User Behavior & Adoption: While smart home adoption, measured by numerous devices, hovered around 10% market adoption for years, smart speakers have injected new life into this space. Adoption of smart speakers grew from 5% in Q4 2015 to 12% in Q4 2016 in US markets alone — a 130% CAGR. With the dominant Amazon having sold some 15.3 million Echos, Dots, and Taps in the last 12 months, according to Parks & Associates. The success of these devices has also made its way into cars, healthcare, and even industrial environments, and voice-enabled virtual assistants are now being integrated in a range of IoT platform solutions.
With adjacent advancements in natural language understanding, the technology leaders powering these devices are also expanding to Germany, France, Spain, and beyond. Interestingly, the smart speaker market in the West mirrors the parallel growth market in the East — social robots — also powered by voice-enabled virtual assistants but more anthropomorphic.

Today’s voice-enabled virtual agents for smart home adoption take different form factors in North America and Western Europe compared to popular devices in Asian markets
User Interface: Voice-enablement and hands-free user interface reduce barriers to entry for all. Simply put, it’s easier and it’s human. We are innately wired to learn and produce language with relatively little effort. Still, while voice is a significant improvement in interface in certain settings — kitchen, driving, holding children — it is not appropriate in all settings or when there is overwhelming background noise.
Impact on Experience: Ultimately reducing the friction of clicking, typing, and tapping with simply speaking introduces new convenience and efficiency. While smart speakers immediately reduce the friction of using technology in the home, they also offer brands new opportunities to improve broader customer experiences. For example, Domino’s Pizza allows enables customers to order a pizza from “anyware” — any hardware, that is — from an Apple Watch to a smart TV to the Google Home.
Both Amazon and Google recently announced, new ‘multi-step’ actions, wherein devices execute multiple tasks with a single prompt, are just the latest updates designed to reduce friction. Simply saying “good morning” to instigate a news briefing, automatically brew coffee, and adjust the lighting for instance, is just another incremental advancement in leveraging voice interface to improve the smart home experience. Brands, manufacturers, and service providers are all flocking towards these devices
User Psychology: The emergence of smart speakers hasn’t just brought voice-interaction into the mainstream, it’s offered a glimpse into the power of anthropomorphizing devices. Never mind that smart speakers look like speakers, consumers expect them to seamlessly interact, and increasingly for agents to “remember” relevant information such as past search queries, feature preferences, and other context, just as a human would.
Pioneered by the likes of Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, consumers expectations for voice-enabled virtual agents are quickly spanning others devices too. Smart speaker owners often report how they expect other devices to have the same functionality — “why can’t I just tell my fan to turn off?”
Meanwhile, unlike in human interactions, virtual assistants are deaf to manners and non-responsive to social faux pas. When assistants fail, users are annoyed, often admitting to yelling or scolding them. Parents lament the fact that their kids can be as mean as they want, and virtual agents will remain subservient and friendly. Implications of these technologies on developmental and adult psychology remain woefully unclear.
Use Cases: Another driver of adoption of smart speakers is that they are inherently ‘horizontal’ in that they support a wide range of use cases. From listening to music, to turning on the lights, to ordering an Uber or virtually any other product, the use cases for these devices look more like a smartphone than any other consumer IoT or smart home device. Similar to a smartphone, wherein making phone calls is a tiny fraction of its capability, a smart speaker is something of a category misnomer; playing music is also just the tip of the iceberg. Instead, these devices are better understood as voice-enabled vehicles for cloud services and mobile apps.
Perhaps one of the most critical impacts of smart speakers in consumer markets is they set a precedent for product appreciating over time, compared to past models in which products only depreciated after purchase. Both Amazon and Google offer open up development to the broader ecosystem meaning manufacturers, brands, and even individual developers can create new apps, new features, and integrations all the time. This open and expanding ecosystem doesn’t just create a better out-of-the-box experience, it also extends the range of potential use cases, users, and value over time.
Access & Mobility: Some technologies help enable or mobilize new segments of people. While this is great for adoption and brand marketers, in certain cases it can also enhance people’s lives. Consider, for instance, how smart speakers are enabling elderly folks to listen to audiobooks, connect with family members, and use home care apps; and disabled folks to enjoy internet services, play games, live more independently, or even offers kids story time enhancement.
Risks & Challenges: Despite the growing success of smart speakers in the home, the technology carries a host of risks and challenges for brands and consumers alike. Zeroing in on impacts to humans, Kaleido analysts identify risks associated with user privacy, data protection associated with cloud-based processing of highly sensitive data, as well as user experience.
A recent murder case cast a spotlight on Amazon as questions of privacy, consent, evidence, caused the company to hand over sensitive Echo data to Arkansas officials. In addition, smart speakers in the US have tangled with the Child Online Privacy Protection act (COPPA) — and soon with the EU’s Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — , prompting Amazon to recently unveil parental consent and control features as well as child-specific skills. And Google’s latest product must have a feature disabled due to a privacy mishap. Even without the sensitive content, most smart speakers today are not designed for multi-user personalization, even if they are used by multiple users.
Technology Proliferation: Although smart speakers have improved the user experience in the smart home, challenges remain on the technology side. For one, no one wants to have 17 different apps for 17 different devices; we don’t want to be system administrators for our homes. And while smart speakers have shifted the form factor of a ‘home automation’ hub (from an app or gateway to a speaker) the administration of these devices, their apps, and data remains a cumbersome user experience even for the technologically proficient.
Then there are additional challenges around interoperability. Consumers don’t want to be boxed in to using single brands or manufacturers, and especially in the home. Although both Amazon and Google offer an impressive (and growing) array of service and product integrations through their Skills and Actions SDKs respectively, they draw a line when it comes to each other. Fiercely competitive Google won’t integrate with Amazon or Apple, and vice versa.
Smart speakers mark an exciting technological shift, most notably in accelerating voice as a mainstream human-machine interface. Over time though, Kaleido analysts expect form factor will be de-emphasized and eventually disappear, as the machine and deep learning behind these virtual agents will:
Learn: They become hyper-personalized to individual users, as we train these systems to become our friends, mates, and more.
Predict: What customers want based on multi-modal historical and real-time data sets Transcend any single form factor, instead “follow” users wherever they go (home, office, car, retail, medical, etc.)
Infuse: almost any physical space with speaking, thinking, predictive services… and sentience? The digital interface is not needed where sound travels.
This is just one of the myriad technologies shifting how businesses interact with consumers and their ecosystems. And these are just a few of the many impacts on consumers today. Kaleido analysts are tracking these and other technologies closely to help you find clarity amidst the chaos. Interested in discussing the impacts of smart speakers? Don’t hesitate to reach out."
10,"How Creepy Is Your Smart Speaker?
Worries about privacy are overstated, but not entirely without merit. Your move, Alexa",smart speaker,https://medium.com/@the_economist/how-creepy-is-your-smart-speaker-a94dc214eedf,"lexa, are you recording everything you hear?” It is a question more people are asking, though Amazon’s voice assistant denies the charges. “I only record and send audio back to the Amazon cloud when you say the wake word,” she insists, before referring questioners to Amazon’s privacy policy. Apple’s voice assistant, Siri, gives a similar answer. But as smart speakers from Amazon, Apple, Google and other technology giants proliferate (global sales more than doubled last year, to 86.2m) concerns that they might be digitally snooping have become more widespread. And now that these devices are acquiring other senses beyond hearing — the latest models have cameras, and future ones may use “lidar” sensors to see shapes and detect human gestures (see article) — the scope for infringing privacy is increasing. So how worried should you be that your speaker is spying on you?
For years the tech industry has dreamed of computing appliances that are considered unremarkable items of household machinery, like washing machines or fridges. The smart speaker has finally realised this promise. It can sit on a kitchen counter and summon the wonders of the internet without the need for swiping or typing. Using it is like casting a spell. Say the magic words and you can conjure up dodgy Eighties rock while up to your elbows in washing-up, or prove to your mum that Ronaldo has scored more goals than Messi. This hands-free convenience has a cost: the speakers are constantly listening out for commands. As with any advanced and apparently magical technology, however, myths quickly grow up about how they work.
So start with some myth-busting. As Alexa herself contends, smart speakers are not sending every utterance into the tech giants’ digital vaults. Despite their name, the devices are simple-minded. They listen out for wake words, and then send what follows to the cloud as an audio clip; when an answer arrives, in the form of another audio clip, they play it back. Putting all the smarts in the cloud means these speakers can be very cheap and acquire new skills as their cloud-based brains are continually upgraded. As part of this improvement, manufacturers (such as Amazon) store sound clips of queries, so they can be assessed by humans if necessary. But Amazon notes that users can delete these clips at any time. There’s always the mute button if you are worried about accidentally triggering your speaker and sending a clip into the cloud during a sensitive conversation. Users, the firm insists, are in control.
Not everyone is convinced by such assurances, however. What if hackers infiltrate the devices? Could governments require manufacturers to provide back doors? Are their makers using them to snoop on people and then exploiting that information to target online ads or offer them particular products? Some people refuse to let Alexa and Siri into the house.
If eavesdropping is your problem, eschewing smart speakers does not solve it. Smartphones, which people blithely carry around with them, are even worse. Spy agencies are said to be able to activate the microphone in such devices, which have even more sensors than smart speakers, including location-tracking GPS chips and accelerometers than can reveal when and how the phone is moving. And smartphones are, if anything, even more intimate than smart speakers. Few of Alexa’s users, after all, take her into bed with them.
At the same time as devices are getting cleverer (Amazon makes a microwave oven with built-in voice assistant), the big tech firms are expanding into adjacent areas such as shopping services, finance and entertainment. Over time this may mean their incentives to snoop and misuse data rise. But there will also be a countervailing incentive for manufacturers to differentiate themselves by making more privacy-friendly devices that promise not to store voice commands, or process more on the device rather than in the cloud (though this will be more expensive). The chief thing is that consumers should be able to choose how to balance convenience and privacy. If this magical technology is to reach its full potential, the tech giants need to do more to convince users that Alexa and her friends can be trusted."
11,The smart speaker war has begun,smart speaker,https://medium.com/futuresin/the-smart-speaker-war-has-begun-e62232c34a07,"According to Allied Market Research the global smart speaker market size in 2017 was valued at $4.3 billion, and is projected to reach $23 billion by 2025 (with a compound annual growth rate of 23.4% from 2018 to 2025). North America constituted the biggest smart speaker market share with 36.9%. Asia-Pacific is also a high performing market with a 24.93% annual growth rate.
This potentially lucrative market has a few big tech firms developing offerings at a rapid pace; and the commotion is quite reminiscent of the old smartphone battles of the 2000’s to say the least. Which players have the best chance to win this war? What is really at stake? Let’s discuss these points.
Battle of the giants: Amazon vs. Google
Amazon Echo and Google Home are the two most popular brands of small, “table-top speakers”. Their smartness lies in the included voice assistants: Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant respectively, which you can ask questions or give commands to inquire about the weather, set a timer or purchase a book.

“Google Home Mini vs Amazon Echo Dot 3 — Who Wins now?” by TechWiser, YouTube.
More than 100 million of Alexa-powered devices have been sold. That’s rare number Amazon’s SVP of devices and services, Dave Limp, revealed to The Verge earlier this year. In December 2018, An RBC analyst estimated Google had sold 52 million Google Home devices worldwide with 43 million in the United States.
What about challenger brands?
Far behind are a few brands that are trying to challenge the Amazon / Google hegemony.
Sonos have been making quality wireless speakers for a while, capable of streaming music from multiple online services and local media libraries in your home.

“Sonos One — Hands On Review” by Digital Trends, Youtube.
With the Sonos One, the company started to incorporate AI (through Alexa). You get the usual Sonos quality plus the ability to use your voice to change songs (or check the weather, etc…).
The HomePod by Apple’ combines a premium speaker and a smart home hub. TechRadar notes it comes with “amazing sound and incredibly intuitive set-up”.

“Apple HomePod Review: The Dumbest Smart Speaker?” by Marques Brownlee, YouTube.
The publication added: “Siri (Apple’s voice-assistant) is only middling in its implementation, and the fact that you’re not able to break out of the Apple ecosystem for many key functions also rankles”.
Fad or revolution?
Last fall, Adobe Analytics surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. consumers to get a better grasp as to how people are using their smart speakers. The company found that the most common uses were playing music (70 per cent of smart speaker owners surveyed) and monitoring the weather (64 per cent).
Moreover, 50 percent of respondents used their speakers to set alarms and reminders, check the news, and execute online searches; roughly one third used their speaker to control their smart devices and order products online.
In other words, the ways people are using the assistants included with speakers is still quite basic. Complex actions such as shopping, food delivery, communicating with friends and family; and research are still emerging trends.
It’s still too early to really predict the impact of smart speakers on our societies but one thing is for sure: the battle between Amazon and Google will be ruthless."
