1,An intelligent personal assistant for task and time management,intelligent personal assistant,https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2039,"We describe an intelligent personal assistant that has been developed to aid a busy knowledge worker in managing time commitments and performing tasks. The design of the system was motivated by the complementary objectives of (1) relieving the user of routine tasks, thus allowing her to focus on tasks that critically require human problem-solving skills, and (2) intervening in situations where cognitive overload leads to oversights or mistakes by the user. The system draws on a diverse set of AI technologies that are linked within a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent system. Although the system provides a number of automated functions, the overall framework is highly user centric in its support for human needs, responsiveness to human inputs, and adaptivity to user working style and preferences."
2,Socially-aware animated intelligent personal assistant agent,intelligent personal assistant,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-3628,"SARA (Socially-Aware Robot Assistant)
is an embodied intelligent personal assistant that analyses the user’s visual (head
and face movement), vocal (acoustic features) and verbal (conversational strategies) behaviours to estimate its rapport
level with the user, and uses its own appropriate visual, vocal and verbal behaviors
to achieve task and social goals. The presented agent aids conference attendees by
eliciting their preferences through building rapport, and then making informed
personalized recommendations about sessions to attend and people to meet."
3,IPA-An intelligent personal assistant agent for task performance support,intelligent personal assistant,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5284791/,"Assisting users in performing their tasks is an important issue in human computer interaction research. A solution to deal with this challenge is to build a personal assistant agent capable to discover the user's habits, abilities, preferences, and goals, ever more accurately anticipating the user's intentions. In order to solve in an intelligent manner this problem, the assistant agent has to continuously improve its behavior based on previous experiences. By endowing the agent with the learning capability, it will become able to adapt himself to the user's behavior. This paper proposes an intelligent personal assistant agent that learns by supervision to assist users in performing specific tasks. For evaluating the performance of the agent a case study is considered, and a neural network is used by the agent to learn by supervision from its experience. We also provide a comparison of our approach with other similar existing work."
4,Adding semantic web knowledge to intelligent personal assistant agents,intelligent personal assistant,https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/5218,"Intelligent Personal Assistant (IPA) agents are software agents which assist users in performing specific tasks. They should be able to communicate, cooperate, discuss, and guide people. This paper presentsa proposal to add Semantic Web Knowledge to IPA agents. In our solution,the IPA agent has a modular knowledge organization composed by four differentiated areas: (i) the rational area, which adds semantic webknowledge, (ii) the association area, which simplifies building appropriate responses, (iii) the commonsense area, which provides common sense responses, and (iv) the behavioral area, which allows IPA agents to show empathy. Our main objective is to create more intelligent and more humana alike IPA agents, enhancing the current abilities that these software agents provide."

important lessons learned during the process. "
6,An operable email based intelligent personal assistant,intelligent personal assistant,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11280-008-0049-x,"The recent phenomena of email-function-overloading and email-centricness in daily life and business have created new problems to users. There is a practical need for developing a software assistant to facilitate the management of personal and organizational emails, and to enable users to complete their email-centric jobs or tasks smoothly. This paper presents the status, goals, and key technical elements of an Email-Centric Intelligent Personal Assistant, called ECIPA. ECIPA provides various assisting functions, including automated and cost-sensitive spam filtering based on corresponding analysis, ontology-mediated email classification, query and archiving. ECIPA can learn from dynamic user behaviors to effectively sort and automatically respond email. Techniques developed in Web Intelligence (WI) are adopted to implement ECIPA. In order to facilitate cooperation of ECIPAs of different users, the concept of operable email, an extension of traditional email with an operable form, is introduced. ECIPA can in fact be viewed as a family of collaborative agents working together on the operable email."
7,Knowledge based engineering and intelligent personal assistant context in distributed design,intelligent personal assistant,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11888598_46,"The work focuses on the problem concerning the application of the KBE approach and its tools in distributed environments. The first period of applying industrial KBE systems did not only show their significant advantages but also revealed their shortcomings. This problem is especially disturbing with distributed design where the potential of communication is very limited. Every design process is closely connected with the designer’s knowledge. In general, this is a very individual knowledge which is stored in the designer’s personal memory. The work represents an attempt of integration of KBE and IPA (Intelligent Personal Assistant), [11], which is the designer’s personal knowledge repository."
8,An IoT-based mobile gateway for intelligent personal assistants on mobile health environments,intelligent personal assistant,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804516300273,"The evolution of mobile devices has triggered the appearance of intelligent personal assistants (IPAs). IPAs are software agents used to support users to fulfill several daily actions. They are supposed to be intelligent in such a way that allows them to give their owners advices about many different subjects. To do so, IPAs must learn about their user behavior and routines. With the current state of the art technologies, scenarios of ubiquitous communication can be created. One of the potential enablers for those scenarios is the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm where machines with decision support systems interact and communicate among them. In an IoT environment, IPAs can interact with other smart objects in order to gain new knowledge and awareness about their users. This paper proposes a novel IoT-based mobile gateway solution for mobile health (m-Health) scenarios. This gateway autonomously collects information about the user/patient location, heart rate, and possible fall detection. Moreover, it forwards the collected information to a caretaker IPA, in real time, that will manage a set of actions and alarms appropriately. The algorithms used for each mobile gateway service, and the scenarios where the mobile gateway acts as a communication channel or a smart object are also addressed on this paper.

Graphical abstract
Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) are software agents used to help users to fulfill several daily actions. Generally, they learn about their user behavior and routines by interacting directly with them. If introduced on ubiquitous communication scenarios, IPAs can interact with other smart objects and improve the knowledge and awareness about their users. One of the potential enablers for ubiquitous communication scenarios is the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm where machines with decision support systems interact and communicate among them. Then, this paper proposes a novel IoT-based mobile gateway solution for mobile health (m-Health) scenarios. This gateway autonomously collects information about the user/patient location, heart rate, and possible fall detection. Moreover, it forwards the collected information to a caretaker IPA, in real time, which will manage a set of actions and alarms appropriately."
9,On the track of artificial intelligence: Learning with intelligent personal assistants,intelligent personal assistant,https://www.j-humansciences.com/ojs/index.php/IJHS/article/view/3549,"In a technology dominated world, useful and timely information can be accessed quickly via Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs).  By the use of these assistants built into mobile operating systems, daily electronic tasks of a user can be accomplished 24/7. Such tasks like taking dictation, getting turn-by-turn directions, vocalizing email messages, reminding daily appointments, setting reminders, responding any factual questions and invoking apps can be completed by  IPAs such as Apple’s Siri, Google Now and Microsoft Cortana. The mentioned assistants programmed within Artificial Intelligence (AI) do create an interaction between human and computer through a natural language used in digital communication. In this regard, the overall purpose of this study is to examine the potential use of IPAs that use advanced cognitive computing technologies and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for learning. To achieve this purpose, the working system of IPAs is reviewed briefly within the scope of AI that has recently become smarter to predict, comprehend and carry out multi-step and complex requests of users."
10,Using intelligent personal assistants to strengthen the elderlies' social bonds,intelligent personal assistant,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-58700-4_48,"Social isolation and loneliness are among the important factors for the degradation of the life quality as the persons’ aging process advances. These factors can have a pronounced effect on the general health and are caused by the decrease in social interaction by the person with the friends, family and ex-co-workers groups. On the other hand, the software and hardware technologies has reached a maturation point were the electronic assistants can acquire information from the user through camera images, as well as to communicate with the user by means of natural voice language. In this context, a model for the adoption of electronic intelligent assistants by the elderlies has been proposed in previous work. In the current work, it is assessed the possibility of using the current consumer assistants to implement the proposed model. Several assistants are analyzed (Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple), assessing their functionalities and how they could be used to assist the elderly in strengthening their social bonds with the family, friends and ex-co-workers groups."
