1,The VoiceBot: a voice controlled robot arm,voicebot,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1518731,"We present a system whereby the human voice may specify continuous control signals to manipulate a simulated 2D robotic arm and a real 3D robotic arm. Our goal is to move towards making accessible the manipulation of everyday objects to individuals with motor impairments. Using our system, we performed several studies using control style variants for both the 2D and 3D arms. Results show that it is indeed possible for a user to learn to effectively manipulate real-world objects with a robotic arm using only non-verbal voice as a control mechanism. Our results provide strong evidence that the further development of non-verbal voice controlled robotics and prosthetic limbs will be successful."
2,Demo of vj-voicebot: Control of robotic arm with the Vocal Joystick,voicebot,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1296895,We explore the use of the Vocal Joystick (VJ) for robotic limb control using a small-scale robotic arm. The purpose of this research is to allow individuals with mobile disabilities to obtain greater independence by continuously controlling a robotic arm with their voice. The VJ-Voicebot relies only on continuous and discrete non-verbal vocal sounds to interact with objects in its environment. The demonstration will allow users to experience real-time control of a 5 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm using sounds produced from their own vocal system.
3,College Voice Bot (Khabri),voicebot,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/900f/00864ad2b8bada90da0bfb61981a8b44f80e.pdf,"Artificial Intelligent Bots are software programs that include AI components to interact with people over text or voice messaging.
Backed by AI, bots today are being used for ordering food, listening to music, finding information about your favorite author,
checking the weather, etc. The AI component of bots helps in recommendations and making decisions for you. Built on NLP and
ML, bots are based on the human ability to learn and absorb information. The college enquiry bot will be built using artificial
algorithms that analyses user’s queries and understand user’s message. This System will be an android application which provides
answer to the query of the user very effectively. User just have to ask their query to the bot which is used for two-way dynamic
dialogues. The system will use the artificial intelligence algorithms to give appropriate answers to the user. User can ask for any
information related to college/university like information about students, teachers, courses, admission process etc. The
applications of this voice bot can be limitless. "
4,A Photo-realistic Voice-bot,voicebot,https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/168405,"Technology is at the point where systems are capable of synthesizing video of human actors indistinguishably from ones in which the actor is present. This research investigates whether or not it is possible to use this technology in order to create a system which, allows video generation of a human actor, that is able to interact with a user through speech in real-time, whilst also remaining indistinguishable from a real human actor. In other words, a photo-realistic voicebot. The work discusses the motivations and ethics, but also presents and tests a prototype system. The prototype aims to take advantage of the latest in real-time video manipulation software to create a natural sounding conversation with an artificially synthesized video."
5,Performance analysis of an integrated data/voice protocol on bus LANs,voicebot,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/544963/,This paper presents a new hybrid protocol by combining the minislotted alternation priority (MSAP) protocol and the CSMA/CD protocol with priority scheme (HMCP) to handle the different demands of data and voice services on bus local area networks (LANs). The stations on the LANs can access the bus with either the MSAP or the CSMA/CD protocol. Analytical formulations are derived to evaluate the protocol performance. The throughput and the mean packet delay are also obtained. The results show that the throughout and the mean packet delay of this protocol are particularly better than that of the CSMA/CD at high loads. The delay of the voice station is lower than that of the data station.

Book Description
We are entering the age of conversational interfaces, where we will interact with AI bots using chat and voice. But how do we create a good conversation? How do we design and build voicebots and chatbots that can carry successful conversations in in the real world?

In this book, Rachel Batish introduces us to the world of conversational applications, bots and AI. You’ll discover how - with little technical knowledge - you can build successful and meaningful conversational UIs. You’ll find detailed guidance on how to build and deploy bots on the leading conversational platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Facebook Messenger.

You’ll then learn key design aspects for building conversational UIs that will really succeed and shine in front of humans. You’ll discover how your AI bots can become part of a meaningful conversation with humans, using techniques such as persona shaping, and tone analysis.

For successful bots in the real world, you’ll explore important use-cases and examples where humans interact with bots. With examples across finance, travel, and e-commerce, you’ll see how you can create successful conversational UIs in any sector.

Expand your horizons further as Rachel shares with you her insights into cutting-edge voicebot and chatbot technologies, and how the future might unfold. Join in right now and start building successful, high impact bots!

support authentic language learning on the bridge of a ship. Voice active Non-Player Characters (NPCs) “voice bots”
were included in the design process to increase the authenticity of helm experiences, including helm commands. Using
an Agile approach, development of a client based “voice bot” avatar was undertaken to complement human controlled
avatar voice communication. While initial analysis indicated a relatively short development phase, the need to work
around proprietary voice software led to a number of tasks that became distractingly large and exploratory on the
programmer’s Agile backlog list. A decision to focus on the first principle in the Agile Manifesto constrained the
solutions that were developed, which led to a working system for creating voice bots. "
