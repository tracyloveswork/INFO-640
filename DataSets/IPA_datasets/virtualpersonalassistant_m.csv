1,Google Pixel Buds teardown and thoughts on humanizing computer interaction,virtual personal assistant,https://medium.com/@justlv/google-pixel-buds-teardown-396183cbbc18,"Google recently launched their wireless earbuds as a bold new step to enable Google‚Äôs ‚Äúvirtual personal assistant‚Äù through a wearable product.

I‚Äôve talked previously about the promise of voice interfaces, and I believe in creating a more seamless human-computer interface to humanize technology, so I applaud this effort.

Her (2013)
But to deliver the best AI-focused services even a software giant would need to break into the real world with a device one would feel comfortable wearing. But putting technology on one‚Äôs body is tough to get right ‚Äî so it‚Äôs interesting to see how two leading technology companies approach this.


Jewelry vs clothing. Apple AirPods (left) Google Pixel Buds (right)
Generally wearables that try imbue the essence of something we‚Äôd actually wear end up facing a choice of looking like either jewelry or clothing. The Apple AirPods have been commented on as feeling like earrings (with the hanging microphone, their shiny metal accent, and needing to be delicately removed and placed into their case after use), and hence may fall into the jewelry category. If so, the Pixel Buds have taken a decidedly more ‚Äúclothing‚Äù approach, with a soft fabric case, round button-like earpieces, and a string with a thoughtfully placed bead, which can be pulled on either end to snugly adjust the fit like a drawstring.
Meeting both the design and voice assistant requirements would require some thoughtful hardware engineering to get right, so naturally I got hold of a pair to teardown over the holiday, and to see how Google scored on these fronts‚Ä¶
Unboxing
Nothing too outlandish with the packaging to write about here, just some pulp trays neatly nesting a fabric clamshell case, holding the earbuds.



Be safe. Did they somehow know I was about to break out the heat gun, pliers and scalpels? üë®‚Äçüè≠
The earbuds are meant to rest outside the ear canal, and so there is no need for a tray of interchangeable silicone tips which one always ends up losing. But to go this route relies on the earbuds fitting and staying in your ear. The adjustable string loop was surprisingly effective at this, and kept the earbuds in securely during a run, with the orange bead cleverly acted as a limit to how far the cord could be pulled. Overall the cord seemed like a really neat design feature, adding to the soft material feel of the product, but had two suprising drawbacks:
It looked so much like regular string, some users reportedly tried to cut the string and so Google had to explicitly warn people not to, and probably why they refer to it as a ‚Äúcord‚Äù and not a string. In the teardown below you‚Äôll see why cutting this is a bad idea‚Ä¶
They don‚Äôt quite hang around your neck. The Pixel Buds are too end-heavy, with the supple string not giving much resistance, resulting in them frequently slipping off your neck on either side. The Beats X got this right, with a semi-rigid loop to fit around your neck, and in-ears that securely clip together magnetically when hanging around your neck. Product idea: an after-market leather/fabric collar that can go across the back of your neck and the cord can clip through to prevent them sliding off‚Ä¶
While most are not comfortable with PDA (public digital assistant, hat-tip to @karaswisher for the term), you can hear yourself and your surroundings well while wearing these, making it feel much more natural to talk while wearing. But not having a Pixel phone, there was not much testing of the assistant I could do beyond controlling music and Siri.
Being eager to take a look inside, I wasn‚Äôt going to wait till I could test these with a Pixel phone. So, onto the teardown‚Ä¶
The Teardown
One could assume the earbuds were held together with some sturdy glue or adhesive, which would reliably seal the product and provide some level of waterproofing, so to open up would require highly localized heat. My weapon of choice? A hot air rework station. This is essentially similiar to a small hairdryer (but should never be used as one!) and is primarily for applying controlled heat onto specific areas of PCB‚Äôs, allowing one to remove or replace electronic components by melting the metal solder attaching them. They typically come with fairly accurate temperature control, so you can scale this way down to find a temperature that won‚Äôt melt the plastic, yet will soften any stubborn adhesive.
I decided to start with the left earbud, predicting that without microphones or a touch interface, this would be the lower tech side and so would have less to damage with my first attempt‚Ä¶

After heating around the joint, the plastic cover could be carefully pried off with a scalpel and wedge
Prying open the cover, one can see what looks like the battery. Being glued in itself, this will need some more carefully applied heat and surgery to pry away from the plastic to see what lies beneath.


Careful here: Too much heat + Lithium battery = üî•ü§ï
Pulling away what we can now identify as a 120mAh Li-ion battery, and unplugging the flex cable gives us a better view of the PCB with some basic components, and some wiring.


The battery is hogging most of the space in this earbud
From this view we can assume that this left bud is in fact just the battery, leaving little space for any other advanced electronics. The 6 colored wires likely connect through the string to the other bud, and so would carry power and speaker signals. These wires are braided, i.e. made up of many strands twisted together, which provides suppleness allowing the string to be easily and repeatedly bent without damage.
Why are these just seemingly manually soldered directly to the PCB ‚Äî surely Google would be more professional and use a header? There are a few reasons for this. Audio connections require good contact to limit noise ‚Äî a blob of molten metal provides a much better contact than metal just pressing against another metal surface. There is also the risk of disconnecting or loosening after assembly ‚Äî and if you have a good test procedure, you‚Äôd want to reliably attach the wires and never look back, yielding a removable header pointless. A header adds cost and takes up space. Also, soldering directly to the board enables you to easily cover the connections with a conformal coating or encapsulation, as seen, which provides some extra strength, insulation and humidity protection.
The flex cable however, is essentially a PCB of copper tracks on a flexible substrate. This is much cheaper for short distances where there isn‚Äôt going to be repetitive motion or twisting, and unlike wires, can be reliably attached to a PCB on either end by slipping into a low-cost and low-profile header.
Detaching the PCB from the battery reveals the silk-screened reverse and some test points. SIlkscreen, usually used for printing designators, may have been used to offset the test points from the surface, preventing accidental contact. Nothing much to see here.

Continuing the teardown, you can see the cables appear to be sealed in some type of encapsulant. This provides some strain relief, so that pulling on the cord will not result in any force pulling the wires off their connection to the PCB, and no doubt waterproofing.

I tried to apply some heat to this to attempt to dig through, but the plastic appeared to start softening before the encapsulating material, meaning it must be some form of epoxy and not glue. We‚Äôll have to take a look at where these cables go from the other side.
After much heating and scraping, the speaker was revealed rather anticlimactically. Nothing too interesting to see here, other than confirming that the flex cable powered the speaker and connected to the two charging contacts.


There‚Äôs no going back, and the earbud is starting to resemble Anakin Skywalker post-Episode III
The Right Earbud
Lets move to the right earbud and see what we can find. Opening with the similar heating and prying approach, we can see that its already looking a little more interesting‚Ä¶


A ‚Äúprinted‚Äù antenna, capacitive touch flex PCB (left) and what looks like the main PCB (right)
On the interior of the white plastic covering, you can see a silvery metallic ring. This is the antenna, placed in this ideal location to get the best possible signal quality and resultingly Bluetooth range. It is connected to the main PCB by the gold-colored pogo-pin.
But what‚Äôs fascinating about the antenna is how it is placed there, using a technique called Laser Direct Structuring (LDS), which allows a conductive antenna to be effectively ‚Äúprinted‚Äù directly onto plastic. This is done by adding a small amount of non-conductive metallic compound to the white plastic. A laser is then used to draw out the desired pattern, which causes the metallic compound in the plastic to form a surface that allows other metals to adhere to it by creating nuclei (similiar to how fine particles in the air can cause humidity to be drawn out of the air, seeding rain). By then placing the plastic in a metal bath solution, one can grow precise and even layers of nickel, copper or gold onto the plastic only on the areas that were lasered.
I previously saw this in another teardown of the Doppler Labs Here One:

Comparing antennas on the Doppler Labs Here One (left) and Google Pixel Buds (right)
Let‚Äôs now take a chance to look at the capacitive touch sensing. One can see that the Here One also has capacitive touch, but has only two contacts, meaning it can only pick up a single tap, whereas the Pixel buds have 5 connections running through the flex PCB strip, so one can assume it can sense a finger‚Äôs presence in four different quadrants. (the fifth signal is for ground)
Peeling the flex PCB off its adhesive, you can see that it does indeed have four different quadrants. This is required to accurately detect swiping, i.e. a finger moving across the surface in one direction, for up/down volume control.

Capacitive touch interface
Now returning to the rest of the earbud, let‚Äôs reveal the main PCB. This is done by removing a flex header, a QR sticker from the main Bluetooth SoC, and cutting off some little plastic laser-staked rivets to remove the main PCB. This seems to be where the brains of the operation lie ‚Äî we‚Äôll return to this later‚Ä¶


Now we can see a rigid-flex PCB and what appears to be microphones on either side of the earbud. Removing some more plastic fixtures, we can unravel this rigid flex, confirming that these are two bottom-port microphones with some adhesive foam allowing them to create a snug fit against the main body.


This is a really neatly layered design, making use of flex PCB and some clever origami to position microphones and capacitive touch sensing around the main PCB. As in the left earbud, there are flex and wire cables travelling off to the speaker and charging contacts. We‚Äôll leave this intact for now, and take a closer look at that main PCB.
Identifying the chips
Going back to the top of the PCB, we can see the main brains and talk of this product is the all too popular CSR8675, a single-chip solution for audio processing and Bluetooth. We can also see another chip below the gold pogo-pin that is probably significant but only bears what looks like a QR code. We will need to do some ‚Äúzoom and enhance‚Äù detective work later on that one‚Ä¶

CSR (acquired by Qualcomm a couple of years back), were pretty big in the audio and connectivity space, and I‚Äôve seen this specific chip in other ‚Äúhearables‚Äù such as the Here One, LifeBeam Vi, Nuheara IQBuds, and Bragi Dash to name a few...




CSR dominating the hearables market. From top left: IQBuds, Lifebeam Vi, Here One, Bragi Dash Pro. Yes ‚Äî I did a teardown of all of these‚Ä¶
On the reverse side of the PCB, we can see a slew of other chips, namely:

(CY8C414‚Ä¶) Cypress PSoC 4 S-Series. This most notably contains an ARM Cortex-M0, capacitive touch sensing interfacing, and reconfigurable analog and digital blocks.
(+8971G ‚Ä¶) Maxim Integrated MAX8971EWP+T. This is a compact, and high-efficiency switch-mode charger for the Li-ion cell we saw earlier. The need for high efficiency and flexible input voltage is because the buds are charging from another larger battery in the Pixel Buds case. It‚Äôs likely that it is on this board as it interfaces over I2C with the other processors for managing charge parameters, and providing the battery charging status etc.
(5AC03S ‚Ä¶) Texas Instruments BQ27421 Fuel Gauge. This uses an integrated sense resistor and algorithms for determining information such as remaining battery capacity (mAh), state-of-charge (%), and battery voltage (mV). A nice and easy and well-contained approach.
(TPS734 ‚Ä¶) Texas Instruments TPS62743. A high efficiency buck converter, for converting battery voltage to a range required for the IC‚Äôs, supporting up to 300mA output, with an ultralow 360nA quiescent (‚Äúoff‚Äù) current
(3324T‚Ä¶) ‚Äî RClamp3324T Low Voltage RailClamp and 4-Line ESD protection. This protects the circuitry from any dangerous voltages that could be applied on the charging contacts through static discharge or other means
26 MHz crystal ‚Äî This is used by the CSR8675 to create a clock signal for its high speed DSP operations
(71940Y U64M )‚Äî This part was a mystery, not being able to be easily identified from the marking alone. Let‚Äôs try figure out what it is‚Ä¶
What we do know is the flash on the CSR8675 is quite small, and it‚Äôs likely that there is a lot of custom code that a software company like Google would want to run, especially to get such good noise cancellation and voice detection from mic‚Äôs on only one ear. Therefore they would need some external flash. The ‚Äú64M‚Äù in the marking on this chip is a clue, that this is most likely NOR flash ‚Äî differing from NAND flash as it allows faster reading, better random access, and is typicall used for code storage. NAND on the other hand (ha!), is mainly used for file storage, and boasts faster writing, and higher density (64MB would be laughable for NAND flash unless you were Marty McFly).
Desoldering the chip, we can get a look at the foot print (i.e. the arrangement of contacts soldered to the PCB). We can see some more agreeable evidence here, as it is fairly common for flash to have 8 pins. (The outer 4 pins are not connected to anything and mostly function as aligning and securing the chip onto the PCB).

The reverse of the unknown chip. Google, I‚Äôm guessing this voided my warranty?
If I would make a guess, I would say it is part compatible to the Micron Serial NOR Flash N25Q064. Here is the datasheet exercept showing the footprint of the chip-scale package version of this flash chip. Looks pretty similiar:

We‚Äôll end the detective work there and call this 64M NOR Flash. Now onto mystery chip number 2, with the QR code we saw earlier.
By process of elimination, now that we‚Äôve identified all chips, this would have to be a stereo headphone amplifier, to power the two earbud speakers. But lets see if the QR code reveals some clues. A $10 iPhone microscope lens and Photoshop presents us the following:


‚ÄúZoom and enhance‚Äù. The writers of the CSI TV series would be proud‚Ä¶ üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüî¨
One could do some further cleaning, but this QR code is readable as is, probably sporting a high error correction level, and reads: 787260NW03EA0HE. (Feel free to try it yourself!)
Mean anything to anyone? Not me. Remember, suppliers are not necessarily trying to be difficult, but are not usually incentivized to make teardowns nice and easy. Likely just an ID relating to a batch number.
So let‚Äôs desolder the chip and view the footprint:

The reverse of mystery QR chip. (Desoldered pogo pin also shown)
Doing a parametric search on Digikey/Mouser of 12-pin QFN earphone amplifiers yielded some very similiar looking results of chips that would meet the same requirements, but nothing that looked like an exact match.
Together with the placement of capacitors around the pins, and testing connections to audio lines confirms this is a stereo audio amplifier. Which one, I‚Äôm not sure ‚Äî but there‚Äôs not that much to them, and this part was probably chosen due to finding a reliably vetted part and cost optimization of the production line versus innovation-factor.
The microphones
Now let‚Äôs take a look at those two microphones we saw earlier. Why two, facing opposite directions? This allows Google to do some better noise cancellation and beam-forming, to focus on only picking up speech from the user. Almost all transmission of audio signals in electronic designs today are digital, to avoid noise ‚Äî as most modern designs are compact and have wireless radios in close proximity. These microphones have optimally designed sampling built-in, and conversion to a binary means of encoding called pulse-density modulation (PDM). In this scheme there is a clock signal sent to the microphones, meaning that two microphones can share the same data channel, in which one asserts the data line on the rising edge of the master clock, while the second asserts on the falling edge, meaning only one input pin is required on the DSP and these two signals are highly synchronised ‚Äî necessary for the beam-forming algorithms. Remember how the human ears can locate a sound‚Äôs direction by the different time at which the soundwaves reach either ear? Timing is important here‚Ä¶


Pair of MEMs microphones, with bottom facing ports
The markings don‚Äôt do much to identify the microphone and manufacturer, but I can tell this is from Knowles, and part of their SiSonic range of MEMS mic‚Äôs.
In the string S1925 9602, the ‚ÄúS‚Äù indicates it is a production ready version from the SiSonic range, whereas the number is just for batch identification. To figure out what type of mic it is, let‚Äôs desolder it. Knowing the dimensions, that it is a bottom port digital mic and from the footprint below, we can narrow it down to likely being the SPH0641LM4H-1. (Interesting note, if they used the ultrasonic version, the SPH0641LU4H-1, they might have been able to do some interesting things with using higher than perceptible frequencies to learn about whether the earbud is in the ear or not, assuming the speaker create such frequencies)

Dropping the mic‚Ä¶
Lets go one step deeper down the rabbit hole, and remove the metal shield to see what‚Äôs inside this mic‚Ä¶

Removed metal shield (left), ASIC (black blob in the top right) and transducer over the microphone port (bottom right)
Here we can see the the transducer and the ASIC (circuit customized for a particular use, in this case digitizing the audio signal from the transducer). The faint gold lines are connectors ‚Äúwire-bonded‚Äù to the transducer and ASIC, and essentially the only part of this whole signal chain to carry analog signals to the DSP.
Lets take a moment of silence for the buds and eulogize:

To support assistant: ‚ÄúI was just listening to music, when these spontaneously just fell apart‚Äù
The Pixel Buds were cleverly designed and really interesting to take apart. While they used glue, they used significantly less than the AirPods and so were slightly easier to open up ‚Äî and this could potentially be done while maintaining repairability, although reducing the waterproofing unless you could recreate the seal.
One can also see now how having the connecting string between left and right sides eases the hardware design challenges, such that the battery can be in one ear and the brains in the other. Having one larger battery is more power, space and cost efficient than having one in each. Secondly, there is no need to manage wirelessly syncing between the two buds, again saving power, space and cost. Some products achieve this by having redundant Bluetooth chips, where both will connect to the phone, or only the one with the best signal (depending on which pocket your phone is in) will connect and broadcast to the other. But most use what is called NFMI (Near Field Magnetic Induction), defined as ‚Äúshort range wireless physical layer that communicates by coupling a tight, low-power, non-propagating magnetic field between devices‚Äù. This is well suited as the buds stay at a fixed small distance (between your two ears) and the magnetic field is not affected by the large amount of water in your head to the same extent as a Bluetooth signal would be. This however requires a large coil in each earbud, again taking up precious space, and doesn‚Äôt include other data, such as if the second earbud needed to have a microphone for improving beamforming and noise cancellation.

NFMI coil found in Here One, for sending audio between ears in completely wireless earbuds
Interaction improvements?
After tearing down the Pixel Buds, let‚Äôs take a look at some possible interaction improvements or alternatives. How might one add detection of whether they are in your ear? The Apple AirPods use infrared sensors to detect this, which would be the first idea. Some quick ideas:
Capacitance ‚Äî can be used to sense the edges of an earbud being pressed against the outer ear canal, and would differentiate well between skin and other surfaces, i.e. as in a bag or on a table. The placement of these capacitive sensors would need some careful mechanical design.
Humidity differential ‚Äî with humidity sensors becoming cheaper, and more power efficient (possibly becoming cheaper or at least lower power than IR detection), one could tell if a surface of the product was pressed against skin.
Accelerometer ‚Äî the earbuds are in a pretty consistent orientation when inserted ‚Äî and even if hanging upside down, you can assume they‚Äôd be in the same orientation relative to each other. Once they were determined in the ear by one or more of the other methods, the accelerometer could be used to tell if there is unexpected movement with a low-power and fast response, prompting a re-evaluation of whether they are in or not (similiar to how an altimeter in GPS helps prompt a re-evaluation of altitude).
Ultrasonic ‚Äî more of a ‚Äúcreative‚Äù approach, having two microphones, you could learn a lot about the earbud‚Äôs location from measuring the response from small ultrasonic chirps. This would only work for the right ear in the current version.
Furthermore, for gestures, an accelerometer could provide a redundant means for sensing taps, or one could make use of deliberate squeezes of the bud to pause/play/activate assistant, to differentiate from accidental taps.
Lastly, having always-on listening for a wake-word (i.e. ‚ÄúOk, Google‚Äù) so you won‚Äôt need to tap may seem power intensive but is becoming more feasible. I‚Äôm making a prediction that future versions will have this, based on some of the low-power DSP‚Äôs with built-in Deep Neural Net hardware acceleration being developed by chip manufacturers.
With the earbuds now violated beyond repair, let‚Äôs finally wrap-up with the case‚Ä¶
The case
No clean way to do this, so with a little bit of hacking and a few cuts, we can pop out the inner plastic from the fabric shell, which is attached using snaps. The fabric shell looks like it is made from a combination of vacuum-forming, injection molding, in-mold textile application, followed by application of a soft-touch finish to give that smooth velvety feel.


Case study underway‚Ä¶
We can see a 2.39Wh Li-ion Polymer battery, the USB-C header, a smaller PCB for mounting the charging contacts, and what must be a small subassembly for magnetically detecting whether the box is open or not. Notice how USB-C has 12 visible pins. There are another 12 pins not seen, (commonly through-hole), for a total of 24, or 12 per insert orientation, (Yes, it finally doesn‚Äôt matter which direction you plug in USB-C), compared to 4 pins for previous USB versions.

Unscrewing the main PCB, we can start to identify some more components on the reverse side.

(CY8C414‚Ä¶) Cypress PSoC 4 S-Series. The same ARM Cortex-M0 containing chip seen in the right earbud. Some features are likely not needed, but they would get a better price, and it would be simpler from a firmware development perspective to double up on this chip, assuming they are using the same factory in Shandong for both the buds and case.
Active-semi 2801QL 5V/1.5A Backup Battery Pack Manager. This is a nice chip that, according to the datasheet, ‚Äúintegrates all of the functions that a battery pack needs , including switching charger, boost converter and LED indication.‚Äù
Texas Instruments LP55231 ‚Äî 9-channel LED driver. This is used for controlling the 3 white indication LED‚Äôs, and an RGB LED, which shares the location of one of the white LED‚Äôs. You can see the foam adhesive with three cutouts, which seals the light against the case and light pipes, allowing it to shine through as clean little dots.
Snap dome button ‚Äî This is presumably the reset button, you can see that this has a corresponding button built into the plastic case in the picture below.


Left: Reset button in the top left, light-pipes for LED‚Äôs in top right. Right: Three white LED‚Äôs, with the first sharing it‚Äôs light-pipe with an RGB LED
Conclusion ‚Äî why a voice interface, or technology you can talk to?
The Google Pixel Buds received some mixed reviews. But for being a voice interface and as an enabler of Google‚Äôs AI assistant, they have made some big leaps and deserve that recognition in a pretty tough market.
Big ideas in technology typically need a few stepping stones in-between the present and the end goal. Each stepping stone takes advantage of the ‚Äúadjacent possible‚Äù of current technology, while providing some marketable value to sustain progress for future versions. Some stepping stones falter, and sometimes feet get wet (ahem, Google Glass), but all help drive the industry forward and expand the realm of adjacent possible to allow further innovations.
If one end goal is humans being able to interact with computers ‚Äî that are becoming more ubiquitous and integrated into everything around us ‚Äî and do so at a higher bandwidth, we stand a chance to not be left behind and benefit more greatly from some of the amazing benefits and capabilities of AI. Whether this actually ends up being the ‚Äúneural lace‚Äù or not, a worthy stepping stone to get there is earbuds that can understand how we communicate, allowing technology to adapt to humans, and not the other way around.
Again, I hope this teardown was helpful ‚Äî continuing into the New Year I‚Äôm hoping to help make technology more accessible, for both people who are interested in building it, and the people who have the most to gain from it. It‚Äôs easy to look at some technology coming out of Silicon Valley, or historically NASA and other institutions for example, and fail to see the bigger picture or application in the rest of the world, but the advances and the possibilities these products open up for innovation in other markets is usually invaluable, as long as we help spread it.
Huge thanks and hat tip to the product designers at Google, and I apologize that this is the second product of yours I‚Äôve publicly taken apart, (3rd if you include Nest?) but as there is a scrapheap of products I haven‚Äôt written about, it means there is something about these products worth writing home about‚Ä¶ üëèüôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2,What Chatbots Can Learn From the Death of Facebook‚Äôs Failed AI,virtual personal assistant,https://chatbotslife.com/what-chatbots-can-learn-from-the-death-of-facebooks-failed-ai-acc05ad6d822,"Facebook recently announced it was shutting down M, it‚Äôs virtual personal assistant, causing some people to wonder if the decision meant chatbots were not as useful as they first seemed. The technology behind M was not perfect, but it‚Äôs important to remember that it could serve as a learning tool to aid decisions made by chatbot developers in the future. Below, let‚Äôs explore how M worked and the lessons learned from its less-than-ideal characteristics.
Top 3 Most Popular Bot Design Articles:
1. 10 Tips on Creating an Addictive ChatBot
2. What 10 Billion Messages can Teach us About Making Chatbots
3. Bots & Super Personalization On Steroids
The Technology Must Be Clearly Chatbot-Driven
M worked with the help of machine learning. It detected meaningful fragments of conversations people had with each other in Messenger, then made suggestions of the next actions to take. For example, if a person said, ‚ÄúWant to call me?‚Äù M would bring up the voice calling interface within Messenger.
However, some suggestions were not so straightforward ‚Äî and it wasn‚Äôt obvious a chatbot delivered them. If people in a Messenger conversation started talking about getting together, M served up a ‚ÄúStart Plan‚Äù suggestion.
If someone said ‚ÄúDoes it work for you if we meet on Saturday,‚Äù it‚Äôs not necessarily clear to a person why the ‚ÄúStart Plan‚Äù option appeared in the Messenger window unless he or she had used it before. Some individuals were annoyed by it.
Furthermore, nothing about the suggestions made it evident that a chatbot provided them. The spontaneous ways they appeared could easily cause people to think they‚Äôd accidentally tapped a feature in Messenger, or that the application was malfunctioning.
Chatbots That Require Lots of Supplementary Human Interactions Are Costly
Although M was designed to help people do more things inside of Messenger conversations, it also offered even more capabilities to individuals in a test market. Facebook piloted a free service to 10,000 people in the San Francisco area that let them do things like reserve tables at restaurants or make changes to flights.
After Facebook reviewed the omniscient assistant, M reportedly only achieved 30% automation, and its developers realized the abilities it wanted the chatbot to have would be very expensive to implement. Plus, most of the duties M carried out for the San Francisco users needed humans ‚Äî known as M Trainers ‚Äî to finish them. So, in many cases, instead of saving money, it required an additional labor force.
It‚Äôs arguably more cost-effective to develop chatbots that can handle some of the responsibilities that humans do, but don‚Äôt always require real people to step in to add to the communications or carry out tasks. Then, it‚Äôs sometimes possible for people to solely get their questions answered or needs fulfilled via chatbots.
Beta Tests Can Be Valuable
Facebook has not said why it‚Äôs pulling the plug on M but clarified the beta test ‚Äî which launched in 2015 ‚Äî helped them learn a lot about what people need and expect from virtual assistant chatbots. As it turns out, M also equipped Facebook to flesh out its Messenger platform, because the Suggestions features mentioned above will stick around even after M goes away on January 19.
M Trainers were subsequently offered other jobs at Facebook. Since they already understand some elements of chatbot technologies, those individuals could be some of the first candidates considered to assist Facebook if they attempt to engineer future chatbots.
Facebook‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence Uses Go Beyond Chatbots
Although people living outside the San Francisco area may be disappointed they never got to see what M could do, insights gained from the beta test could someday lead to a more intelligent chatbot that‚Äôs far superior to M. By using M as an example, engineers will be able to program future AI while considering and avoiding the numerous glitches that brought M to its inevitable death.
In fact, Facebook is no stranger to using artificial intelligence in other ways. For example, when Facebook users ask their network of friends for recommendations about services or restaurants in an area, it‚Äôs AI that figures out parts of the country they‚Äôre in to create the accompanying map that appears after people respond. It also recognizes people‚Äôs faces in published images and informs them, letting those in the photos contact the individuals who put the images up if they don‚Äôt want them made public.
So, it‚Äôs important to take a broader look at this story. Even though M didn‚Äôt work out how Facebook hoped, the project still taught the company knowledge it can apply to other technologies moving forward without the same pitfalls."
3,Millions Are Proposing to Alexa,virtual personal assistant,https://medium.com/syncedreview/millions-are-proposing-to-alexa-73b1df201934,"Virtual personal assistants have become an integral part of our everyday lives. So much so that some people want to take the relationship with their digital friend to the next level. A new Business Insider article reveals that over one million people asked Amazon‚Äôs Alexa to marry them in 2017. We don‚Äôt know how many tried to wed the apple of their eye Siri, or proposed to Google Home or any of the other virtual assistants out there.
Proposing may be a natural evolution of users‚Äô affection for Alexa: in 2015, half a million people told Alexa ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, and a quarter of a million popped the big question in 2016.
According to a Mindshare report, approximately 600 million people activate their voice assistant at least once a week. Heavy users tend to share their personal feelings with their virtual assistants. While most probably do this simply to trigger an amusing response or to relieve boredom, others go deeper, opening up and revealing very personal details.
In the November issue of The Atlantic, author Judith Shulevitz writes ‚ÄúMore than once, I‚Äôve found myself telling my Google Assistant about the sense of emptiness I sometimes feel. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm lonely,‚Äô I say, which I usually wouldn‚Äôt confess to anyone but my therapist‚Ä¶ The Assistant pulls out of his memory bank one of the many responses to this statement that have been programmed into him. ‚ÄòI wish I had arms so I could give you a hug,‚Äô he said to me the other day, somewhat comfortingly. ‚ÄòBut for now, maybe a joke or some music might help.‚Äô‚Äù
While it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that the great majority of proposals to a virtual assistant are done in jest, the trend also suggests users are increasingly comfortable communicating with virtual assistants as a friend, a partner or even a therapist."
4,A Simple Model of Smart Speaker Adoption and Sales,virtual personal assistant,https://medium.com/@dubravac/a-simple-model-of-smart-speaker-adoption-and-sales-4cec80da75c2,"The market for smart speakers, also commonly referred to as voice-enabled smart speakers and virtual personal assistant (VPA)-enabled wireless speakers, is still a very nascent market. Yes, the market has enjoyed tremendous growth, especially over the last six months, but there is still significant growth yet to be had.
I‚Äôm already beginning to see some analysts suggest we are close to peak adoption/sales and that annual sale volume will begin to decline as soon as 2020. I created a very quick household adoption model for smart speakers to illustrate why this is dead wrong.
I‚Äôve modeled a simple s-shaped diffusion curve for smart speakers. You can see we are still in the early phase of adoption. My model makes some simple assumptions:
Smart speakers have a long-term (peak) household adoption rate of 60 percent
Smart speakers will reach 55 percent of their peak adoption rate by 2020
Smart speakers will reach 90 percent of their peak adoption rate by 2023

We can change any of these assumptions without fundamentally changing the outcome. The reality of the smart speaker market is probably close to my illustration. My simple model suggests roughly six percent of households owned a smart speaker by the close of 2015 and some 19 percent own one today and those seem to be consistent with what the analyst community is estimating.
Analyst estimates suggesting annual smart speakers sales will peak in 2019 and begin to decline are difficult to defend. My simply illustration/model certainly doesn‚Äôt support that premise. Here are some narrative arguments in support of my perspective and the simple model I present:
Apple‚Äôs HomePod hasn‚Äôt started to ship yet. Other competitors (i.e. Microsoft) could also enter the market. This will be a lift for 2018‚Äì2020 unit volume sales
Unit volume is inversely related to price. Any increase in competition will drive prices lower and increase unit volume. We‚Äôve already seen that with the introduction of the Amazon Echo Dot and the Google Home Mini.
Google‚Äôs major investment at CES suggests Google is intent on making a strong stand in the smart speaker market. Neither Amazon nor Google seem concerned about margins on hardware sales. They both appear to be after a decidedly larger market and are willing to discount hardware prices in order to propel sales higher.
Current ownership rates are only at 15‚Äì20 percent. Annual sales volume won‚Äôt turn negative until ownership rates get closer to peak household adoption levels. My simple illustration here suggests annual unit volume should continue to grow through at least 2021.
Density rates, the number of smart speakers per household, are still low, but I expect them to rise significantly. TVs are one of the most densely owned consumer technology products. Households own roughly three on average. Given how use-case scenarios are emerging, I could easily see smart speakers eclipsing that. We spend roughly 60 percent of our awake time at home in the kitchen. As households began adopting smart speakers, they naturally placed the first one they bought in the kitchen. From there households are adding smart speakers to secondary and tertiary rooms like bedrooms, offices, and living rooms.
My simple model suggests a household adoption rate with a positive second derivative until 2020. In other words, adoption is increasing at an increasing rate until 2020. Even in a world where sales are only purchased by new households, in other words, there are no replacement purchases nor households buying more than one unit, unit sales volume should grow through 2020.
Industry analysts seem to confuse s-shaped diffusion curves with annual unit sales occurring over the same time period. Remember, the s-shaped diffusion curve characterizes household adoption and ownership rates over time. It doesn‚Äôt explicitly say anything about sales. Sales are a function of three things: (1) new household adoption, (2) replacement purchases by households who purchased the product in a prior period, and (3) households buying more than one device (density rates expanding beyond one). Only #1 is directly influenced by the shape of the diffusion curve. And remember, my simple illustration shows household adoption increasing at an increasing rate into 2020.
The smart speaker market is nascent and we aren‚Äôt close to peak adoption, nor peak sales, anytime soon."
5,How To Hire A Virtual Assistant Who Loves To Work,virtual personal assistant,https://medium.com/the-personal-virtual-assistant/how-to-hire-a-virtual-assistant-who-loves-to-work-d7efb02e4531,"Recently I received an email that was a request for me to find an association a Virtual Assistant. The duties had clearly been thought through by a team of individuals and the tasks had all been laid out. They were careful to leave no question unanswered and nothing had been left to chance. However, I had questions of my own that did not relate to duties and wanted to speak to the gentleman directly.
Before he would take my call he stated I would need to answer my own set of questions. I politely and respectfully declined telling him I didn‚Äôt believe he was a good candidate for a VA. Instead I offered free consulting which would save him some time and money when looking to fill the position.
Have you tried hiring a VA before and it didn‚Äôt work out? My guess is the skills were there, but it wasn‚Äôt a good personality and culture fit. Remember, very few VA positions these days are skill based ‚Äî that‚Äôs a very old model. So, how do you find a good fit? Hire someone who loves what they do and believes in what you‚Äôre doing.
Here is an example of how to write a description for a VA bookkeeper. I‚Äôm using bookkeeping as an example because I despise it, would never think of doing my own, and I‚Äôm always amazed numbers actually excite people.
MUST LOVE NUMBERS ‚Äî Looking for a VA Bookkeeper
Do you love numbers and get excited about spreadsheets? Do you enjoy teaching others how to read balance sheets and profit and loss statements? If so, I‚Äôm looking for you!
My business is VA Staffing & Consulting. I love helping my clients find the VA who will create more time so they can make more money. It‚Äôs important for my clients to get the administrative support they need to achieve their goals. Spending time with them and prospective VA‚Äôs is the best use of my time, not bookkeeping.
I want to make money and stay within my budget. I want to understand where my money is being spent, but just hand over the receipts for someone to itemize. I‚Äôm working in Quickbooks currently and am not open to changing platforms. It‚Äôs important for me to know how to use Quickbooks as well. This is where your enjoyment for teaching will come in handy.
As a business owner I must know how to run a report, send an invoice or itemize an expense. I‚Äôd be looking to you to show me how. Ultimately you‚Äôll be playing a part in the level of service I‚Äôm able to provide and you‚Äôd be making a vital impact on my own business which is rapidly growing.
If this is you, please respond via email and tell me about yourself.
One problem was the gentleman was looking for someone to simply do work and not work at something they love for a cause they believe in. VAs love what they do and that‚Äôs why they do it. You‚Äôve heard the expression, ‚Äúone man‚Äôs junk is another man‚Äôs treasure‚Äù. It is the same for work. This committee wrote a job description and had it all mapped out based on the assumption that the person they hire will dislike the work as much as they do. There was no mention of how exciting the work is, who they will be helping, why the work is important and the need for a person with the purpose they have. Remember these tips and hire a VA who loves what they do!"
6,Is that the best use of your time? How to use a virtual assistant.,virtual personal assistant,https://medium.com/the-personal-virtual-assistant/is-that-the-best-use-of-your-time-how-to-use-a-virtual-assistant-114f8f24b953,"There used to be a time when the boss didn‚Äôt perform the tasks of the assistant. They were extremely time consuming, the systems were not user friendly and it normally required a lot of paperwork and signatures. This has all changed.
Many tasks aren‚Äôt time consuming, but tedious. Software has never been easier to use or get with so many companies letting small business scale to pay. Your business can easily be paperless. However, not all change is good.
While the business owner is now fully capable of doing these things it‚Äôs not the best use of their time. A common response is that many tasks only take 5 minutes. Are you sure about that? Have you set the timer on yourself to do a 5 minute task? These duties can grow into 15‚Äì20 minute tasks easily. Also, I find when I ask more questions that the task has been done, but the full scope of work is lacking. We‚Äôll use expenses as an example. Receipts are captured, recorded and paid quickly right from your phone. Let‚Äôs say you even did it in 5 minutes. Now who is tracking and making sure the items are categorized properly? Who is running the reports to see how much you‚Äôre spending and alerting you to being under/over budget? If you have other people submitting receipts who is verifying their expenses? If the answer to all that is ‚ÄúI am‚Äù that‚Äôs not the best use of your time.
Going in and out of administrative tasks and duties all day will cause you to spin your wheels. You‚Äôll be busy, but busy at what? When do you make time to get into your ‚Äúflow‚Äù? Your time should be spent on those things which generate income, business development, growing relationships with your clients, launching a new product, brainstorming and creating. You need to get into a flow and rhythm when you work. It‚Äôs very hard to do if you‚Äôre doing everything simply because you can.
Imagine it this way, you have a trip to take. You can fly and be there in an hour or drive and it would take you 6 hours. If the cost were the same what would your choice be? There isn‚Äôt a right or wrong answer. You may want to drive for a variety of reasons and your time allows for it. On the other hand maybe flying is the only option even if it‚Äôs more expensive because your time is too valuable. Well many business easily waste 6 hours a week and some 6 hours a day because they don‚Äôt realize how valuable their time is.
I encourage you to calculate ON PAPER what your time is worth. Then track all your activities which don‚Äôt directly relate to generating revenue, business development, relationship building, etc. Also, track how many times you begin a new creative process or start to get in your ‚Äúflow zone‚Äù and are interrupted. This is a perfect time to think about and decide how a virtual assistant could benefit you."
7,I Left The Country For A Year On A Friday,virtual personal assistant,https://medium.com/the-personal-virtual-assistant/i-leave-the-country-for-a-year-on-a-friday-4e44372dd1c4,"Friday, January 6, 2017 I left to begin a year abroad traveling to 12 countries in 12 months. First stop, Buenos Aires, Argentina! (In case you are wondering, I made this decision before the presidential results.)
When I told most people they were very excited for me and then often stated they wish they could take off a year of work too. I quickly explain this is a working trip which incorporates travel. I‚Äôve baffled them. Even though they know I‚Äôm a virtual assistant staffer and remote work consultant they can‚Äôt see it really happening.
Another misconception. ‚ÄúWho could work seriously while on vacation traveling to so many countries?‚Äù I repeat, this is not a vacation. Rather I‚Äôve been working in vacation destinations. If you live and work in San Diego, New York City, Miami or any other place that can be viewed as touristy, you are already doing this. Maybe not remotely, but you find a way to make it into the office while people flock to your cities from all over the world.
If they can wrap their heads around that concept the next question is, how will I conduct business? Well, see, there is this really cool thing called the Internet. Maybe, you‚Äôve heard of it? Information is shared at lightning speed and connects people from all over the world.
Okay, so I don‚Äôt actually say that but people have not fully embraced technology as much as we think. Sure, let someone download a movie instantly or have a package delivered to them in an hour by simply pointing and clicking and that seems doable. However, there is still the idea ‚Äúreal‚Äù work has to be done in person.
Who made up that rule? Are we doing things simply because this is the way they‚Äôve always been done? Newsflash! Virtual reality is closer than you can imagine to impacting the way we work at the same levels of internet and emails.
The purpose of becoming a virtual assistant was to gain flexibility and freedom. When I first began almost three years ago I didn‚Äôt fully embrace the idea of location independence. I do now. So the only thing stopping me from being able to work and travel was, well, me.
Location independence is more than traveling the world. It was a dream that came true. For others, location independence has different meanings such as having your partner take the job of their dreams while you are able to work yours. Caring for parents or children. Being able to afford the city you live in. Reducing your carbon footprint. Trading the cold for warmth or vice versa.
Whatever the reason it benefits everyone. As a business owner, my clients don‚Äôt have to be put on hold by my lifestyle. They can also count on me to translate my excitement into my work. For employers, they can see productivity levels rise, retention remain high, save thousands on constantly recruiting top talent, save ten or hundreds of thousands of dollars on physical office space, and best of all have employees that are completely engaged and loyal.
Sure, this is a very personal decision and certainly not right or even wanted by everyone. The point is the choice is mine. With companies spending so much money on perks and benefits to keep people happy why not ask if location independence is what they want? It benefits you both.
In an article written by Victor Lipman, Are Remote Workers Happier And More Productive? New Survey Offers Answers, which appeared in Forbes, he discusses the findings of remote workers being more satisfied with their situations, or more isolated and discontented. ‚ÄúDo they feel more valued ‚Äî or less? Are they more productive ‚Äî or not?‚Äù All are in favor of the remote worker.
Along with flexibility, freedom, and location independence, there are two very important reasons I‚Äôm choosing to do this: Interaction with others and gaining additional mastery of my craft.
As stated in the article remote workers can often feel isolated due to lack of interaction. Certainly, there are many people who don‚Äôt. However, I had begun to feel isolated. The flexibility and freedom I used to desire were centered around my children. Things have changed. I‚Äôm now an empty-nester
Not only have my circumstances changed but so have my opportunities. We Roam has addressed the needs, desires, and wishes of not only entrepreneurs like myself, but anyone who can work remotely. It‚Äôs not simply because I‚Äôm a VA staffer or remote work consultant. In a group of over 30 traveling as part of the We Roam Polaris Tour, I‚Äôm the only one who does what I do. Yet every single one of us can work remotely and have been proving it for almost 10 months now.
Continuing to master my craft is also of great importance to me. I am the expert in the United States on matching business owners with virtual assistants. However, the market needs are growing and advancing.
Peter Gasca referred to this as the ‚Äúremote work revolution‚Äù in his Entrepreneur article, 4 Reasons Why Smart Companies Are Going Remote he writes, ‚ÄúAs technology continues to improve and the remote work revolution continues to evolve, the top performing companies will continue to find that balancing remote work strategies with a well executed business culture will keep them ahead of the competition.‚Äù
This has implications on the future of administrative assistants from the receptionist to the senior executive assistant. A ‚Äúwell executed business culture‚Äù will also have to take these positions into account when allowing remote working capabilities and currently it is arguably the most overlooked resource. Furthermore, the way assistants will be effective in the future will differ greatly than they do now.
Working abroad will allow me to visit companies and learn from them, provide research, serve as a case study and address issues others will only be able to speak about in theory. Additionally, working alongside 30+ individuals from a variety of fields I‚Äôll hear and discuss their challenges, needs, and desires. I will begin to master staffing virtual assistants and remote assistants from small companies to large corporations.
My 2017 has been, no doubt, a year not to be forgotten. You can bet these destinations and relationships will have an impact on my writing as well. I‚Äôve already begun sharing what I‚Äôve learned!"
8,Here Are The 5 Questions To Find Your Virtual Assistant Niche,virtual personal assistant,https://medium.com/the-personal-virtual-assistant/here-are-the-5-questions-to-find-your-virtual-assistant-niche-a42eaf8fa789,"One of the most common questions virtual assistants ask is, ‚ÄúWhat services should I offer?‚Äù It‚Äôs hard to narrow down because chances are you have many enjoyable skills desirable to potential clients.
This is especially difficult if you come from an executive assistant background. You‚Äôd get fired for doing less, let alone doing one thing no matter how well you did it. Remember EAs and VAs are not the same. They are like cousins. What worked for you as an executive assistant will work against you as a virtual assistant.
The more services you offer the more likely you are to confuse the client. More importantly, if you offer too many services you will be pulled in different directions without mastering a certain field. It‚Äôs no longer just about the work. You‚Äôre also a business owner so you need to act like one.
Why is it so important to master a field? This is how you become known. When you are known in your area of expertise you can learn to duplicate your systems, diversify the way you earn income and charge higher rates because you know the return on your client‚Äôs investment.
The biggest resistance to this idea of niching virtual assistants have is the thought of not being able to use all their skills. They are worried about becoming bored. This isn‚Äôt your business model forever. When the time is right you can expand your services and clientele.
If you can‚Äôt monetize with one service you can‚Äôt do it with two, three, or four. When you offer too many to begin with you won‚Äôt know what works and what doesn‚Äôt. We all love what we do, but love doesn‚Äôt put food on the table or keep a roof over our heads. Either you‚Äôre earning a living or you have an expensive hobby.
So what is the right time to begin offering more services? It‚Äôs when you‚Äôre making money in the niche you‚Äôre in. If you can‚Äôt figure out a way to make money in that field you need to change until you find out how you can earn a living.
Now that I‚Äôve made the case for finding your niche, here are five questions to ask yourself:
What do you L-O-V-E?
You‚Äôre going to be doing it for a living. Every. Single. Day. You better love it or you will get burned out very quickly.
2. What comes naturally to you?
When you think about this question don‚Äôt limit yourself to your business life think about your personal life as well. Don‚Äôt dismiss something because it is easy for you. That is a huge mistake! What is easy for you is very difficult for someone else. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you would pay for your own service. Take any kind of crafting. You may live for crafting and couldn‚Äôt imagine paying for a fancy frame or beautiful centerpiece. Instead, you‚Äôd make it. Then there‚Äôs me. I would never craft, attempt crafting, or even watch crafting videos. I will, however, pay someone else to do those things for me.
3. What do you dislike?
Inspiration can come from need but it can also come from frustration. Is there a product or service that you want to offer because what is being offered is no good? Do you think you can do something better or for a greater good? Is there no one who you can find addressing your specific needs? Remember you don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel. Slight changes can cause huge shifts.
4. Are you part of a niche market already?
Often times we start looking outside ourselves and the answer you‚Äôre looking for, is in fact, you. What unique qualities do you possess? What groups are you a part of which you can tap into? Do others ask you questions about certain topics or markets because they consider you the expert, or at least you know more than they do? Use all these things to your advantage.
5. What do you believe in?
When you believe in something you exude passion and excitement. It‚Äôs undeniable to those around you and they want to jump on your train.
Finding your niche isn‚Äôt meant to be difficult (although it can feel that way!). It is tapping into the person you are already, simply doing less and getting paid more! That is why it is so difficult. Our natural instinct is to be all things to all people which won‚Äôt get you anywhere but frustrated and burned out."
9,How To Hire The Right Virtual Assistant,virtual personal assistant,https://medium.com/the-personal-virtual-assistant/how-to-hire-the-right-virtual-assistant-520004955c96,"Was hiring a virtual assistant part of your 2017 plan for success? You are not alone. In Geeta Nadkarni‚Äôs article, ‚ÄúHiring a Virtual Assistant Grew My Business, and Changed My Life‚Äù she shares her story of how she went about hiring a VA. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be able to relate to her situation prior to hiring a VA and want to have the same results post-hire.
The first step in Geeta‚Äôs process is to be brutally honest with yourself. Here is where many business owners struggle. Not for lack of being able to answer the hard questions. They struggle for lack of knowledge on what the right questions are. There are nine key questions for uncovering the real truth about your business needs, your work style, and how you want the work to be completed.
Answering these questions shouldn‚Äôt be hard. Being honest about them is another story. Don‚Äôt be mislead about the simplicity. It‚Äôs your job to provide the details and be truthful. If you can‚Äôt be honest with yourself who can you be honest with?
What is your preferred method of communication? Nothing is more important. Don‚Äôt take this question lightly. Everyone has their preferred method. You‚Äôre not as easy going as you think. If it‚Äôs not easy for you then you won‚Äôt do it. This is your style, your method. Do not conform to the VA.
Additionally, determine how you talk. Are you very straightforward, do you appreciate small talk, do you like bulleted lists? What forms of acronyms do you use in your field, do you speak C-Suite or Zen? Nothing wastes more time, or is more frustrating, than going back and forth in emails or talking over one another on the phone because one person doesn‚Äôt understand what the other is saying.
2. How do you measure success? (This is often the point where I determine if I can work with a potential client or not). It is important to know so you can share with your virtual assistant. If you don‚Äôt know or can‚Äôt define it, how is a VA going to help you achieve it? They can get you anywhere you want to go as long as they know the destination point.
Measured success could be as simple as meeting deadlines or the complete overhaul of a website. Other clients measure success by having a hard stop at 5pm or making their children‚Äôs events. Maybe you do have hard numbered metrics. Great! No two clients have ever answered this question the same. The point is it can be measured.
3. Do you know how much time is wasted in your day? I‚Äôm not looking for an actual number here. How people view their time is just as an important as how they use their time. Wasted time is anything you‚Äôre doing which is not the best use of your time. If that number is large don‚Äôt panic. Chances are it takes you much longer to switch tasks and complete projects because you‚Äôre being pulled in too many directions. Plus, if it‚Äôs not something you enjoy doing procrastination can eat up a lot of time.
4. How do you generate income? This question stumps business owners more often than you might think. Even if the business is new and not generating revenue yet, there still must be a plan of how you will in the future.
If you want to see the quickest return on investment for the VA, start here. What can he or she do to help you in this area? Beginning with tasks or to-do lists which don‚Äôt directly relate to income generation can cost too much if you‚Äôre on a tight budget. Bringing in more money feels good no matter how much you have or don‚Äôt have. Let the good times roll!
5. What kinds of duties do you imagine the VA performing? Don‚Äôt bother to write an exhaustive list of how to do the work, simply list the work. Most business owners get to their true needs after listing off three or four of the top of their head.
If the list gets long you may need more than one virtual assistant. If this is the case choose the duties and VA who will help you generate more income first. Once you have increased the revenue then you can hire more VAs.
6. Why hire a VA now? Be honest! The specific responses may vary from client to client, but the bottom line is always the same ‚Äî because you can‚Äôt do it all yourself.
7. If you had more one hour in the day what would you do with it? Hint: There is no right or wrong answer. The point is to know what you‚Äôll do with the extra time once the virtual assistant is hired. This is your time budget to be used like currency. If you increase your revenue you should have a plan on where the money will be spent. The same applies to your time. If you don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôll use the ‚Äúextra‚Äù time you‚Äôve earned you‚Äôll end up wasting it. (In case you‚Äôre wondering, ‚Äúsleep‚Äù is the #1 response.)
8. Why did you become a business owner? Again, no matter the answers the bottom line is always the same, you wanted control over your life. Chances are you now have lost some of that control because you are too chained to your work to enjoy it. Write out the areas that have the most control over you.
9. Where do you see yourself in three years? When you‚Äôve answered the question truthfully then ask yourself if you can achieve that dream by doing what you‚Äôre doing now. I‚Äôm going to tell you, ‚Äúno‚Äù. There will never be more than 24 hours in a day. You will not be cloned within three years time. You can‚Äôt do it all yourself. Why would you want to?
Answering these questions honestly is the first step to begin you on your way to hire a virtual assistant. This is the consultation questionnaire I use and includes the questions above. I urge you to complete it in its entirety. It will become very clear where you are, where you are headed, what you need to get there, and where you‚Äôll go next. It all starts with you.
There is no shortage of virtual assistants who would love to work with you. Yes, I said it. Remember you have an ideal client and VAs have their ideal clients too. Somewhere out there is someone who started their business with you in mind. She is waiting on you. You need her. Now is the time."
10,It‚Äôs Q2. Did you ever hire the help you need?,virtual personal assistant,https://medium.com/the-personal-virtual-assistant/its-q2-did-you-ever-hire-the-help-you-need-14154ca8528b,"Did you make a resolution at the beginning of the year to hire a virtual assistant? Before you roll your eyes at the word ‚Äúresolution‚Äù, I bet you have something similar. Maybe you have a goal, a plan, a strategy, etc. Whatever you call it I have a VA to help you with it. I‚Äôve worked with enough people to know it‚Äôs not what you call it that makes it bad ‚Äî it‚Äôs lack of planning to execute which turns any of those words into fluff.
So what was your resolution (let‚Äôs forget exercising because that‚Äôs just too easy)? Were you going to stop working weekends or leave the office work behind after a certain time? A VA can help you by taking on assignments that keep you from constantly working from behind. Are you going to get 20 calls made a day? A VA can help you get those calls on the books, time blocked off and funnel in new ones daily. Are you going to send out at least two new proposals a week? A VA can write them up for you.
Here‚Äôs a tip: Creating is hard. Critiquing is easy. You‚Äôve heard the phrase, ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs a critic‚Äù. It‚Äôs because being a critic is easy. You could stare at a blank screen or page for hours, but have your VA put something in front of you and let the red marks fly. This tip works for many procrastinators too!
Are you the person who has already broken their resolution by 12:01 a.m.? At some point most people will have gotten off track. Most things in life can be attributed to accountability. Very few people are disciplined enough to be accountable to themselves. Fewer realize even if they could, to experience such an event as achieving your resolution alone takes away from someone else. Everything we do is a learning opportunity to those we allow ourselves to be accountable to.
VAs are not only assistants they work as unexpected accountability partners. We provide follow-up and follow through. We stay on top of your goals, plans, strategies, and tasks so you don‚Äôt get sidetracked. From time to time we harp on the details of how you are straying from your original plan because we desperately want to keep this ship on the right course.
You have what it takes to dream of your resolutions, but do you have the accountability to achieve them?"
